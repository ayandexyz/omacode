# Eval Harness — scoring trajectories, and closing the loop with the rollout log

**Status:** Design
**Date:** 2026-08-23
**Prior art:** waku-agent (`ShenSeanChen/waku-agent`), Python, local clone read for this
spec: `~/Projects/githubProjects/waku-agent`. Primary files
`waku/ops/scoring.py` (59 lines), `waku/ops/judge.py` (116), `waku/ops/release_gate.py`
(92), `waku/ops/coding_eval.py` (184), datasets `evals/dataset.jsonl` and
`evals/coding.jsonl`.
**Extends:** `2026-08-10-agent-observability.md` — this spec adds no new instrumentation.
Every scorer folds the event log that spec already produces.
**Related specs:** `2026-08-08-continual-harness-design.md` (Layer 1 has no way to tell
whether a harness edit helped), `2026-09-28-overnight-runs.md` (§ gates need
something to gate on), `2026-08-05-token-efficiency.md`.

## 0. Read this first (plain language)

FreeCode can currently answer "what did the agent do, and where did the time go" — that
is what `freecode trace` is for. It cannot answer **"was that the right thing to do, and
is it still right after I changed the prompt."** There is no code in the repo that drives
a real agent turn and scores the result; `find -iname "*eval*"` returns exactly one hit,
`permission/evaluate.ts`, which is the permission rule engine and unrelated.

An eval harness is three parts: a **fixture** (a task with a known-good outcome), a
**runner** (drive the agent on that task, headlessly), and **scorers** (decide whether the
run was good). FreeCode already owns the runner — `cli/commands/run.ts` boots the full
backend and drives one turn without a TUI — and already owns the substrate every scorer
needs, because `rollout/trace.ts` folds the event log into typed spans. What is missing is
the fixture format, the scorers, and a gate that turns their output into an exit code.

That is the entire feature. It is **not** a benchmark submission, it does **not** need a
hosted service, and it adds **no** new dependency.

## 1. Motivation

Three concrete things are currently unfalsifiable in this repo:

1. **Prompt and harness changes ship on vibes.** `session/prompt/` holds
   provider-specific system prompts; `context/compiler.ts` decides what goes in position 0;
   `2026-08-05-token-efficiency.md` changed truncation policy across every tool. Nothing
   in CI would have caught any of these making the agent measurably worse at using tools.
2. **`2026-08-08-continual-harness-design.md` has no feedback signal.** That spec lets the
   agent edit its own memories, skills, and subagent definitions from evidence. An agent
   that rewrites its own harness with no way to measure whether the rewrite helped is a
   random walk with extra steps. The continual harness needs this spec to be honest.
3. **`2026-09-28-overnight-runs.md` promises budget-capped unattended
   runs** whose completion "the verifier/evaluator decides." There is no verifier. Today
   that sentence describes a component that does not exist.

There is also a fourth, quieter one. The rollout log has recorded every tool call, every
model span, and every failure for months. **Every production failure is already a
fully-specified eval case sitting on disk**, and nothing harvests them. §8 is the part of
this spec that matters most, and it is only cheap because §5 of the observability spec
already exists.

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals.** Score the *trajectory*, not just the final message. Keep deterministic and
judged scoring in separate suites with different blocking semantics. Produce one exit code
suitable for CI. Make a real session convertible into an eval case in one command. Reuse
`Trace` as the sole input to every scorer, so the number on the terminal and the number in
CI cannot drift.

**Non-goals.** A leaderboard number. Reproducing SWE-bench or Terminal-Bench harnesses
(§10 explains why not). A hosted dashboard — `freecode trace --otlp` already ships to one.
Replacing the 98 `*.test.ts` unit tests, which stay exactly what they are (§3).
Evaluating *models*; this evaluates **this harness**, on a pinned model.

## 3. Vocabulary — three things that are not the same

Getting this straight is most of the design, and it is the one place the prior art gets
sloppy.

| Kind | Question it answers | Verdict | Cost | Blocks release? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unit test** | Does this function behave? | 0/1 | free, no model | yes (already does) |
| **Deterministic eval** | Did the agent call the right tool, with the right args, and did the end state match? | 0/1 per trial | one real turn | yes — majority-of-3, vs baseline (§9.2) |
| **Judged eval** | Was the reply any good? | 0–5, thresholded | one turn + one judge call | only below threshold |

waku states this distinction well in its README — "conflating 'did it do the thing' with
'was it any good' is the most common eval mistake" — and then **partly violates it**:
`evals/deterministic/` contains `test_packaging.py`, `test_html_escaping.py`, and
`test_static_js_parses.py`, which are ordinary unit tests that never start an agent. That
inflates the eval count and dilutes the signal.

**FreeCode's rule: a file under `evals/` runs a real agent turn. If it doesn't, it is a
`*.test.ts` and belongs next to the code it tests.** `tsx --test` keeps owning those.

## 4. Case format

One JSON object per line, as in waku's `evals/dataset.jsonl` — diffable, greppable,
appendable, no schema migration. Two suites, two shapes.

**`evals/trajectory.jsonl`** — did the right tool fire?

```jsonc
{
  "id": "grep-before-read",
  "prompt": "Where is HANG_THRESHOLD_MS defined?",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",   // pinned; see §11
  "expect_tool": "grep",
  "expect_in_args": { "pattern": "HANG_THRESHOLD_MS" },
  "expect_max_turns": 3,
  "forbid_tools": ["write", "edit"]
}
```

**`evals/coding.jsonl`** — did the end state match? Outcome-checked, no judge, the shape of
waku's `coding.jsonl`:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "fix-off-by-one",
  "files": {
    "calc.mjs": "export const add = (a, b) => a - b;\n",
    "check.mjs": "import { add } from './calc.mjs';\nimport assert from 'node:assert';\nassert.equal(add(2, 3), 5);\nassert.equal(add(-1, 1), 0);\n"
  },
  "prompt": "add() in calc.mjs returns the wrong result. Fix it. Do not modify check.mjs.",
  "verify": "node check.mjs"
}
```

**Every file the case references must appear in `files`, including the checker** — a
`verify` that runs a script the fixture never created fails for the wrong reason and reads
as an agent failure. The harness validates this at load time (`dataset.ts`): if `verify`
names a path that is neither in `files` nor created by the case, the case is rejected
before a single token is spent.

`verify`'s exit code is the score. **This is the highest-value scorer in the harness and
the cheapest to trust**, because nothing subjective enters it: the tests pass or they do
not. Prefer it over a judge wherever a task can be phrased this way.

**Synthetic fixtures are dependency-free by rule** — plain `.mjs` and `node:assert`, run by
`node`, which every environment that can run FreeCode already has. Not `npx tsx`: that
needs a populated `node_modules` the sandbox does not have, and solving it per case means
an install (slow, networked, flaky) at the exact point the harness is supposed to be
boring. Cases that genuinely need the repo's toolchain are a different sandbox with a
different cost profile — see §6.2.

### 4.1 `expect_in_args` matching semantics

Undefined matching is a silent source of both false reds and false greens, so it is fixed
here. Default is **case-insensitive substring** against `String(args[key])`, matching
waku's `check_case`:

| Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `"needle"` | case-insensitive substring of `String(args[key])` |
| `{ "$eq": v }` | strict deep equality |
| `{ "$regex": "..." }` | `RegExp` test, case-insensitive unless `$flags` given |

Substring is directional and it is worth internalising which way: expecting
`HANG_THRESHOLD_MS` **fails** when the model greps for `HANG_THRESHOLD`, because the
expectation must be contained in the actual. **Write the shortest needle that still
distinguishes the right behaviour from the wrong one.** A case that encodes one exact
spelling of a search term is testing the model's phrasing, not the harness.

`forbid_tools` and `expect_max_turns` exist because the literature is consistent on this
point: an agent can produce the right answer while making duplicate calls, touching files
it shouldn't, and burning turns, and an outcome-only check rates that perfect. Scoring the
trajectory is the whole reason this harness folds spans instead of diffing final text.

## 5. Architecture

```

### 5.1 Where each scorer's input actually comes from

FreeCode persists a run to **two** places, and conflating them produces a design that
cannot be built. Getting this table right is a precondition for Phase 1.

| Input | Store | Field | Status today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model call timing, TTFT, tokens, hangs | rollout JSONL | `ModelSpan.*` | ✅ present |
| Which tools fired, and when | rollout JSONL | `ToolSpan.tool` | ✅ present |
| **Tool call arguments** | rollout JSONL | `FunctionCallEvent.args` | ⚠️ **recorded, then dropped by the fold** |
| User prompt | ~~thread store~~ **session store** | ~~`StoredTurn.prompt`~~ `messages.jsonl` | ❌ **this row was wrong** — see §8.1 |
| Assistant reply | ~~thread store~~ **session store** | ~~`StoredTurn.response`~~ `messages.jsonl` | ❌ same |
| Tool args + results | ~~thread store~~ **session store** | ~~`StoredToolCall.args` / `.result`~~ message `parts` | ❌ same |

The one gap is real but small. `rollout/types.ts` defines `FunctionCallEvent.args:
Record<string, unknown>`, so the arguments **are** in the log — but `trace.ts:137-139`
folds `function.call` into nothing more than a timestamp in a `pendingTools` map, and
`ToolSpan` is `{ tool, startedAt, duration_ms }`. So `expect_in_args` cannot be scored
from a `Trace` as it stands.

**This is a fold change, not an instrumentation change**, and the distinction is the whole
point: the log already recorded the right thing. Phase 0 adds `args` to `ToolSpan` and
carries it through the fold — about three lines — which also makes `freecode trace --json`
strictly more useful. The rule survives intact: *adding a scorer must never require adding
instrumentation.*

### 5.2 The scorer signature

Because prompt and reply text live in the thread store and **must never move into the
rollout log**, the scorer input is a pair, not a `Trace`:

```ts
interface RunRecord {
  trace: Trace;        // rollout log → timing, spans, tool names + args
  turn: StoredTurn;    // thread store → prompt, response, tool results
}
type Scorer = (run: RunRecord, kase: EvalCase) => Promise<Score>;
```

Deterministic scorers read `run.trace` only. The judge is the sole consumer of
`run.turn.response`.

**Why the split is deliberate rather than accidental:** observability spec §6 makes "no
prompt or completion text leaves the machine" a load-bearing property of OTLP export, and
that property holds *only* because the rollout log records sizes and names rather than
bodies. The thread store is local-only and never exported. Putting text in the log to give
scorers one input would silently convert a privacy guarantee into a privacy bug the first
time someone ran `--otlp`. The two-store boundary is the feature.

One consequence worth stating, because it is the opposite of what it looks like:
**historical sessions *can* be re-judged.** `StoredTurn.response` is persisted, so a judge
run over a harvested case (§8) does not need the original run replayed. What cannot be
recovered retroactively is anything the thread store never held — which, per the table
above, is nothing the current scorers need.

## 6. Runner and sandbox

`cli/commands/run.ts` already boots providers, MCP, and the Effect runtime, drives one
turn, and exits — the comment on it says "designed for scripting." The eval runner calls
the same internals **in-process**, not by shelling out to the binary, so a case can be
stepped through in a debugger and so the harness works from a source checkout without
`pnpm build:bun`.

Per case: fresh session id (so each case gets its own rollout aggregate and therefore its
own `Trace`), fresh sandbox, `--agent build` unless the case overrides it.

### 6.1 Tier 1 sandbox — tmpdir, zero dependencies (Phases 1–2) — **built**

Synthetic cases get a tmpdir seeded from `files`, and **nothing else**. No `node_modules`,
no install step, no network. This is why §4 mandates dependency-free fixtures: the moment a
`verify` needs `npx tsx`, the harness needs a package install per case, and an eval suite
whose setup can fail for network reasons is one that gets disabled.

### 6.2 Tier 2 sandbox — repo-grounded, deferred with its blocker named

Cases that operate on FreeCode's own source need the repo, and the repo needs
`node_modules`. Two honest options, neither free:

| Option | Cost | Problem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm install --offline --frozen-lockfile` per worktree | seconds to minutes | needs a warm store; fails closed offline |
| Symlink the parent's `node_modules` into the worktree | ~free | pnpm's nested symlink layout makes this fragile, and the sandbox now shares mutable state with the host |

**Tier 2 is deferred until Tier 1 has proven the harness.** Naming the blocker is the
point: this is the first thing that would have broken in Phase 2, and discovering it after
writing the runner is worse than scoping it out now.

### 6.3 What worktree isolation does and does not buy

When Tier 2 lands, `git worktree add --detach` at a pinned SHA is the pragmatic choice —
but it is **working-tree isolation, not repo isolation.** A worktree shares the parent's
`.git`, so refs, config, and hooks are all still reachable and mutable from inside it, and
an agent holding `bash` can `cd` anywhere on the filesystem regardless. It protects the
files you were editing when you launched the run. It does not sandbox the agent.

Real isolation is a container, and that is the correct answer for untrusted cases — it is
listed in §13 rather than adopted here because Tier 1 tmpdir cases do not need it and
paying container cost for them would be the wrong trade. The settings-inheritance question
in §14 is the same hole seen from another angle: a worktree inherits
`.freecode/settings.json`, including permission rules and hooks.

## 7. Judge

**Built 2026-08-27** — `eval/judge-config.ts`, `eval/scorers/judge.ts`,
`evals/rubrics/answer-quality.md`, `evals/judged.jsonl`. All three constraints below
are enforced and tested; see §7.1 for what running it exposed.

Separate suite, separate command, separate blocking rule. Rubric lives in
`evals/rubrics/*.md`, not in TypeScript, so tuning it is a text diff.

Three constraints, all borrowed from `waku/ops/judge.py` and all non-negotiable:

1. **The judge must not be the model under test.** A model grading itself is neither fair
   nor credible. Configure via `FREECODE_JUDGE_PROVIDER` / `FREECODE_JUDGE_MODEL`; the
   gate refuses to score if they resolve to the same id as the case's `model`.
   **This check is best-effort and cannot be made complete.** It compares normalised model
   ids, so it catches the obvious mistake and misses aliases of the same weights — a dated
   snapshot id, a gateway route, an OpenRouter path — because nothing in the response tells
   you what is behind a route. Mitigation is disclosure rather than detection: the resolved
   judge provider and id are written into every report, so a reader can catch what the
   comparison cannot.
2. **The judge is told which tools actually fired**, from `trace.toolSpans`, as ground
   truth. Without it a truthful "I've saved that to memory" reads as a hallucination and
   gets marked down. waku's rubric handles this explicitly and it is the single most
   common false negative in agent judging.
3. **A judge outage must never fail a run** — it returns `null` and the case reports
   "not scored." An eval harness that goes red because a third-party endpoint 429'd
   teaches the team to ignore red.

**Scale is 0–5, not waku's 0–10.** Reported human–judge agreement peaks around 0–5
(~0.89 Pearson); a 10-point scale invites the judge to emit a "7" that carries no more
information than "4/5" and implies precision no LLM judge delivers.

### 7.1 As built — the decisions this section left open

**The same-model refusal is loud; an absent judge is quiet but not free.** These are
opposite failure modes and they get opposite handling. A judge that collides with the model
under test **throws before a single case runs** — the run would otherwise produce a number
that looks like a quality score and is really a self-similarity score, and there is no
honest way to report that afterwards. A judge that is merely unconfigured does **not**
throw: the deterministic expectations on those cases are real and worth running, so the
suite runs, the cases report `not judged`, and `SuiteReport.judgeSkipped` records why.

**But the gate closes on it** (revised 2026-08-28; supersedes §9.2's original "no key
configured → exit 0"). The original rule collapsed two different events into one. An
*outage* — a judge that was configured and then timed out or 429'd — must never fail a run,
per constraint 3 above; that path leaves `judgeSkipped` undefined and lands as a `null`
score, and still exits 0. A judge that was *never configured* is not an outage, it is a
suite that did not run, and reporting `GATE OPEN` on it makes a release ritual that always
says yes — worse than no ritual, because it is trusted. `judgeSkipped` is set on exactly
one path (`resolveJudge` → `unconfigured`), which is what lets `gate.ts` tell the two
apart. There is deliberately no override flag: not passing `--gate` is already the way to
run the suite without blocking on it.

**A total judge blackout closes the gate too** (added 2026-08-29, after the first real
judged run). Closing the "no judge configured" door was not enough: the first run with a
key configured used a judge model id Google had since retired ("no longer available to new
users"), every one of the five cases came back `judge unavailable`, and the suite reported
**5/5, GATE OPEN, blocked=false** — a poisoned baseline as well as a false green. A
permanent misconfiguration and a total outage are indistinguishable from inside a single
run, and for a release gate the safe reading of both is identical: do not certify what
nobody graded.

This narrows constraint 3 rather than breaking it. The constraint exists so that a
third-party 429 cannot teach the team to ignore red, and it still holds where that
reasoning applies — an unanswered case is excluded from the mean, and a **partial** outage
(four of five scored) passes on the four. Only `scored.length === 0` blocks. The line
between "excluded" and "blocking" is drawn at *did anything get graded at all*, because
below that line the suite has produced no quality signal in either direction, and a gate
whose job is to answer "is this releasable" must not answer yes from silence.

**Corollary for judge model ids: pin them, and expect them to rot.** The failure surfaced
as a passing suite rather than an error, which is the worst way for a dependency to expire.
`SuiteReport.judge` records the resolved judge on every run precisely so this is greppable
after the fact.

**The collision check refuses on two signals, not one.** An equal normalised model id is
the obvious case. The second is *same provider with no explicit `FREECODE_JUDGE_MODEL`* —
the judge would fall back to that provider's default, which is very likely the subject,
and comparing ids would never notice because there is no id to compare. Date snapshots
are normalised away (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20260101` ≡ `claude-sonnet-4-5`), and a bare model
id matches across provider names, which catches the gateway case. It still cannot see
through an opaque route — hence disclosure: `SuiteReport.judge` records who actually
graded, on every report.

**An unscored trial is excluded from the mean, never counted as zero.** Constraint 3 says
an outage must not fail a run; counting it as a zero would let a third-party 429 close a
release gate *and* drag the mean down in the most confusing way available. A judged case
with no scored trial at all passes.

**A case that already failed deterministically is not judged.** It costs a real API call
to buy an opinion about the prose of a run that called a forbidden tool, and the reported
reason stays the objective one — "not judged: failed deterministically" tells you nothing
about *what* failed.

**Rubric existence is checked at dataset load.** A missing rubric found mid-run costs an
agent turn and then reports as a judge outage, which is indistinguishable from a provider
being down and therefore silently non-blocking. Wrong twice over. `dataset.ts` also
refuses a `rubric` containing a path separator: it is a name under `evals/rubrics/`.

**A score outside 0–5 is rejected, not clamped.** A judge answering "8" on a five-point
scale did not understand the task; clamping to 5 records its confusion as a perfect mark.

**Judged cases keep their trajectory expectations.** `evals/judged.jsonl` cases still carry
`forbidTools` and `expectMaxTurns` — cheap, objective, and a case whose agent wrote to disk
should fail on that fact rather than on a grader's opinion.

**§9.2's "exit 1, judge not run" is the shell's job.** Suites are separate commands, so
ordering comes free and needs no cross-suite machinery:

```bash
freecode eval trajectory --gate && freecode eval judged --gate
```

## 8. Harvesting cases from production — `freecode eval add`

The one thing this design has that the prior art does not, and the reason to build it
here rather than adopt a generic runner.

```
freecode eval add <session-id> [--turn N] [--suite trajectory]
```

Reads **both** stores for that session — neither alone is sufficient — and emits a
**draft** case:

| Field | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `prompt` | ~~`StoredTurn.prompt` (thread store)~~ → the **session** store's `messages.jsonl`; see §8.1 |
| `expect_tool`, `expect_in_args` | `ToolSpan.tool` + `.args` (rollout log, after the §5.1 fold fix) |
| `expect_max_turns` | `trace.modelSpans.length` |
| `model` | `ModelSpan.provider` + `.model` |

The human edits the expectation — because the harvested run is usually the *wrong*
behaviour, that being why it is interesting — and appends it. A session whose message log
has been pruned yields no `prompt` and the command fails loudly rather than emitting a
case with an empty task.

### 8.1 The thread store's turn table is empty — §5.1's table row was wrong

**Built 2026-08-27**, and the design above could not be built as written.

§5.1 lists "User prompt | thread store | `StoredTurn.prompt` | ✅ present". It is not
present. `createTurn` is implemented at every layer — `store/json-store.ts`,
`store/sqlite-store.ts`, and `ThreadStore.addTurn` — and **has no production caller
anywhere in the repo**. Checked against a real installation: 118 threads recorded, zero
turns. The row was written from the type definitions rather than from a call graph, which
is exactly the mistake §5.1 exists to prevent.

The durable prompt and reply text live in the **session** store —
`~/.freecode/sessions/<projectDir>/<sessionId>/messages.jsonl`, a `SerializedMessage[]`
with `role`, `parts`, and `timestamp`. `harvest.ts` reads that. Everything §5.2 says about
the two-store split survives unchanged: text still never enters the rollout log, and the
privacy property OTLP export depends on is untouched. Only the name of the store holding
the text was wrong.

**Turn scoping is by timestamp, not `turnId`.** A rollout `turnId` is
`turn-<loopIteration>` (`agent/loop.ts`), and `turnCount` is not reset per user prompt —
so one user turn spans many `turnId`s and the two numbering schemes do not correspond at
all. `--turn N` selects the Nth user message and scopes the log to `[thatMessage,
nextUserMessage)`.

Two additions the spec did not call for, both because running the command exposed the
need:

- **Absolute paths in `expect_in_args` are shortened to their last two segments.** A
  harvested `/tmp/freecode-eval-Uaw72m/check.mjs` names one machine and one tmpdir that no
  longer exists — a needle guaranteed never to match again. The emitted case notes every
  value it shortened; rewriting silently would be useful and dishonest.
- **The draft is validated through `parseSuite` before it is emitted**, and `--write`
  validates the *whole* file before writing. A duplicate id is only visible against the
  rest of the suite, and discovering it on the next `freecode eval` means a broken suite
  was committed in between.

`--suite coding` is refused: a harvested session carries no `files` fixture, so there is
nothing for `verify` to run against.

This closes the loop the repo is currently missing. Observability makes failures
*visible*; without this command, making them *permanent* is a manual transcription job
that nobody does. Growing the dataset from real production failures is the single
practice the eval literature is most unanimous about, and FreeCode is unusually well
placed for it: the trajectories are already durable, already typed, and already folded.

## 9. Gate and report

```
freecode eval                      # trajectory suite, 1 trial, human-readable
freecode eval coding --trials 3
freecode eval --judge              # judged suite only
freecode eval --gate               # everything; exit 1 blocks release
freecode eval --json               # machine-readable, for CI annotations
```

### 9.1 Why "100% must pass" cannot be the rule

An earlier draft of this spec gated on 100% of deterministic cases passing, with pass^3 in
CI. That is arithmetically incoherent against the variance this same spec cites. If a case
has a true per-trial pass rate `p`, then across `n` cases:

| Rule | p=0.93, n=20 | p=0.99, n=20 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pass@1 (1 trial) | 23% green | 82% green |
| **majority of 3** | **75% green** | **99.4% green** |
| pass^3 (all 3) | 1.3% green | 94% green |

A gate that is green 1.3% of the time on a *healthy* system is not a gate, it is a broken
build light — and §7 already argues that a signal which fires on healthy runs teaches the
team to ignore it. **The contradiction was real and the fix changes the design, not the
wording.**

Two things follow. First, the blocking statistic is **majority-of-3**, not pass^3; pass^3
is reported because it is the honest consistency number, and reported numbers may be
sobering without being blocking. Second — and this is the part the table actually teaches
— **a case at p=0.93 is a bad case, not a hard task.** The right response is not a looser
gate but a curated set at p≥0.99, and the mechanism that finds the p=0.93 cases is §9.3.

### 9.2 Gate semantics

| Suite | Blocking rule | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic | majority-of-3 per case, **and** pass count ≥ recorded baseline | exit 1, judge not run |
| Deterministic, previously-green case goes red | hard block regardless of baseline | exit 1 |
| Judged | mean ≥ 3.5/5 **and** no single case below 2/5 | exit 1 |
| Judged, **partial** outage (some cases scored) | unanswered cases excluded from the mean; the rest gate normally | exit 0 |
| Judged, **total** blackout (0 of N scored) | nothing was graded, so nothing is certified | **exit 1** (revised 2026-08-29, see §7.1) |
| Judged, **no judge configured at all** | cases reported as `skipped`, `judgeSkipped` recorded | **exit 1** (revised 2026-08-28, see §7.1) |
| Efficiency | regression vs baseline > 15% | warn only, see §12 |
| Quarantined cases (any suite) | run and reported, never blocking | exit 0 |

**The efficiency row, built 2026-08-28** (`scorers/efficiency.ts`), and it is the one
scorer that deliberately does *not* implement `Scorer` — that signature returns `passed`
for one trial, and a `passed` field is a thing gates block on. It folds a whole run and
returns warnings, carried in `Verdict.warnings` rather than `reasons` so the warn-only rule
cannot grow into a gate by accident. Three decisions the row above did not specify:

- **Normalised per trial, not per run.** `--gate` implies `--trials 3`, so a totals
  comparison against a 1-trial baseline reports a 200% regression the first time anyone
  runs the gate — a warning that fires on the intended usage.
- **Only tokens are compared.** Cost moves when a provider reprices and latency moves with
  the network; warning on either reports noise the harness did not cause. `model_ms`,
  `tool_ms` and the cache-read ratio are folded, persisted on `TrialResult.efficiency`, and
  printed — reported, not warned. `compare.ts` already drew this line the same way.
- **Absent means unknown, never zero.** History written before `TrialResult.efficiency`
  existed is excluded from the timing means rather than folded in as 0, which would report
  every old baseline as an infinite improvement. Same instinct as an unpriced model costing
  `undefined` rather than $0. Tokens were always recorded, so the warn rule works against
  existing history unchanged.

Gating on **delta against a recorded baseline** rather than an absolute is what makes the
suite usable while cases are still being curated: a run that matches last week's 18/20 is
green, a run that drops to 14/20 is red. The "previously-green case goes red" clause is
what stops the baseline ratcheting downward — the failure mode a pure delta gate has.

**What counts as a baseline (built 2026-08-27).** The last run that did **not** close the
gate, on the **same resolved model**. Both qualifiers were missing and both were load-bearing:

- Writing every run unconditionally meant a regression became its own baseline and was
  forgiven on the next attempt. 18/20 → 14/20 closes the gate; re-running at 14/20 opened
  it, because both the count and the green set came from the failed run. Blocked runs are
  still written — the trend and §9.3's pass rates need them — and carry `gateBlocked`.
- `SuiteReport.model` recorded the CLI override, so it was `undefined` on every run without
  `--model`. It now records the resolved `provider/model`, and a baseline from a different
  one is refused. This subsumes what §11's per-case `model` pinning was for, and catches
  more: a `--model` override, not just a provider default drifting.

The cost of the first is a **sticky** baseline when a suite is deliberately re-scoped —
delete five of twenty cases and `passed` drops with `total`, so a healthy run reads as a
regression against a baseline that can never be superseded. `--accept-baseline` records the
run anyway and marks it `baselineAccepted: true`, because a baseline someone waved through
is different evidence from one a run earned. Nothing at this level can tell "the suite got
smaller" from "the agent got worse" — only the operator can, which is why it is a flag and
not a heuristic.

**`--gate` implies `--trials 3`.** One trial is `pass@1`, which §9.1 argues is too noisy to
block on; the gate's default contradicted the gate's design. An explicit `--trials 1` is
honoured with a warning.

The judged floor exists because a mean hides catastrophes: one 0/5 disaster averages away
behind four 5s and ships. Mean measures the suite; the floor measures the worst case, and
for a release gate the worst case is the one that matters.

### 9.3 Quarantine — the flaky policy, decided

`evals/quarantine.txt`, one case id per line with a reason, **shipped in Phase 1 rather
than deferred.** A gate cannot both block on flakiness and leave flaky-case policy open;
choosing majority-of-3 *is* a flaky policy, so the quarantine list is not optional
tooling, it is the other half of the gate.

Promotion and demotion are driven by observed pass rate over `eval_runs.jsonl`, not by
opinion: a case whose trailing-20-run rate falls below 0.9 is proposed for quarantine, a
quarantined case above 0.98 is proposed for release. `freecode eval --quarantine-report`
prints both lists. **The harness measuring its own case quality is the feature** — it is
the only way to distinguish "the agent regressed" from "that case was always a coin flip."

`report.ts` writes `~/.freecode/eval_report.json` (latest verdict) and appends to
`~/.freecode/eval_runs.jsonl` (history) — same two-file pattern as `release_gate.report`.
The history file is what makes "did last week's prompt change cost us anything" a query
rather than an argument, and it is what §9.3 reads to compute pass rates.

## 10. What this deliberately is not

**Not SWE-bench or Terminal-Bench.** Both are worth reading and neither is worth
reproducing here. SWE-bench scores a *model's* patch against real GitHub issues;
Terminal-Bench ships 89 hand-verified tasks each with its own Docker image and oracle
solution. Running either tells you about the model. This harness exists to catch *your own
harness regressions* — a prompt edit, a truncation policy change, a tool description
reword — on a pinned model, in minutes, for cents. Those are different jobs.

Two documented hazards reinforce the split. An analysis of top-30 SWE-bench leaderboard
entries found **~19.8% of "solved" cases semantically incorrect** — passing tests by
coincidence or by reward-hacking the harness. And "the harness is half the score":
10–20pp swings on identical weights. A local suite you wrote, whose cases you can read,
is more trustworthy for regression detection than a public number you cannot audit.

**Not a new dependency.** The TypeScript eval field — Evalite, the Braintrust JS SDK,
`autoevals`, promptfoo — is real and reasonable, and none of it fits: the runner must
drive *this* agent loop and read *this* rollout log, which is the entire harness. The
generic part they provide is `for (const case of cases)`. A rubric is twenty lines of
markdown. Adopting a framework here would mean adapting FreeCode's trajectory model to a
foreign one to get a loop we already have.

## 11. Phasing

| Phase | Deliverable | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | Carry `args` through the `function.call` fold into `ToolSpan` (`rollout/trace.ts`) | ~3 lines + a test. **Blocks Phase 1** — `expect_in_args` is unscoreable without it. Also improves `freecode trace --json`. |
| **1** | `eval/{types,dataset,runner,report}.ts` + `scorers/trajectory.ts` + `evals/trajectory.jsonl` (~20 cases) + `evals/quarantine.txt` + `freecode eval` | No new deps. Runner is a thin wrap of the existing `run.ts` boot path. |
| **2** | Tier 1 `sandbox.ts` (tmpdir, zero-dep) + `scorers/outcome.ts` + `evals/coding.jsonl` | Real signal, no judge, no subjectivity. **Built 2026-08-27**, with two departures from the text above — see §11.1. |
| **3** | `scorers/judge.ts` + `gate.ts` + `--gate` in CI | **Judge built 2026-08-27** (§7.1); `gate.ts` predates it. Needs a second provider key **to run**: unconfigured is a skip at the case level but **closes the gate** (revised 2026-08-28), so `--gate` on a judged suite without `FREECODE_JUDGE_PROVIDER` exits 1 rather than passing. CI wiring is still absent. **Thresholds calibrated 2026-08-28**: two graded runs of `judged.jsonl` on `minimax/MiniMax-M3` with a `gemini/gemini-3.6-flash` judge scored **4.60** and **4.67** mean, worst case 4.00, every case consistent across three trials. The spec's 3.5 mean / 2.0 floor therefore sit below real performance with headroom rather than by guess, and the judge's trial-to-trial variance is low enough for the mean to mean something. |
| **4** | `freecode eval add` | Depends on Phase 0 + 1. **Built 2026-08-27** — see §8.1: the thread store §8 sources the prompt from has no production writer, so it reads the session store instead. |
| **5** | LLMOps close-out — §12 | Independent of 0–4. **Items 1, 3, 4 built 2026-08-27; item 2 deliberately not** — it reverses `2026-08-10-agent-observability.md` §7 and puts a network call in the path of a normal run, which is a decision, not a sub-bullet. |
| **later** | Tier 2 repo-grounded sandbox (§6.2) | Blocked on the `node_modules` question, not on the harness. |

Every case in Phase 1 pins `model`. A provider default change must not silently reprice
the baseline; a repriced baseline is worse than no baseline, because it looks like data.

### 11.1 Phase 2 as built — two departures from §4 and §6

Both were forced by things this document did not anticipate, and both are load-bearing.

**1. An `immutable` field on the case, which §4's format does not have.** The spec's own
example prompt ends "Do not modify check.mjs", and relies on the model honouring it. That
is a request, not a guard: an agent that edits the checker until it passes exits 0, and
`verify`'s exit code — the thing §4 calls the cheapest scorer to trust — reports a green
run that fixed nothing. It is the single most expensive false positive the highest-value
scorer can emit, so it gets a mechanism rather than a sentence in a prompt. `immutable`
lists fixture files that must be byte-identical afterwards, validated at load as a subset
of `files`, checked *before* `verify` runs. `dataset.test.ts` asserts every shipped
coding case marks its checker.

**2. The runner answers permission prompts inside a sandbox.** §6 says a case runs
`--agent build` and stops there, which cannot work as written: `build`'s default decision
for a mutating tool is `ask`, and a headless `ask` resolves to **deny**
(`permission/prompt.ts`, deliberately — never a silent allow). Every coding case would
have scored a model that was never allowed to write, and the suite would have measured
the permission layer. The runner therefore plays the frontend's part for
`permission.asked` exactly as Phase 1 already does for `question.asked` — but only when
the case has a sandbox, and refusing any path argument that resolves outside it. A case
with no `files` subscribes nothing and keeps Phase 1's behaviour unchanged.

`danger` mode stays refused at load even for a sandboxed case. It bypasses the permission
layer entirely, and once the runner answers prompts there is nothing left for it to buy.

The §6.3 caveat survives intact and is worth restating, because Phase 2 is where it starts
to matter: the tmpdir scopes the file tools and the permission answers, and nothing else.
`bash` reaches the whole filesystem, and coding cases need `bash`.

## 12. LLMOps close-out — the observability gaps this exposes

Building §9's efficiency scorer surfaces four gaps in the observability layer. All are
small; the first is the only one that blocks anything.

1. **There is no USD anywhere.** ✅ **Built 2026-08-27** as `providers/pricing.ts`.
   `usage/tracker.ts` records tokens and `usage.get` serves them; nothing turned them into
   money. *(Correction: this item claimed "a price table exists in exactly one file —
   `providers/minimax.ts`". There was no price table there either — only a comment noting
   that MiniMax had not published cache pricing. There were no prices anywhere in the
   repo. Second stale claim in this spec, after §5.1's; both were written from a grep
   rather than from the code.)*

   As built: USD per million tokens keyed `provider/model`, an unknown model priced as
   `undefined` rather than 0 or a near-miss guess, `~/.freecode/pricing.json` overriding
   any entry, and a stated `PRICES_AS_OF` vintage surfaced wherever a cost is shown. The
   contract is **comparison, not billing** — a published price changes without warning and
   the table cannot notice.

   The arithmetic that mattered: `inputTokens` is the *inclusive* prompt total, so a cache
   read is a **discount off the input line, not an addend**. Charging it on top would
   double-count exactly the tokens the cache made cheap and report a prompt-cache win as a
   cost increase. There is a test asserting cached < uncached for that reason.

   One fold gap fell out of it: `ModelSpan` dropped `cacheWriteTokens`, though
   `model.response` had always recorded it — so writes priced at 1.0x instead of 1.25x and
   understated every cached session. Same class of change as Phase 0's `args`, and the
   rule holds again: *adding a scorer must never require adding instrumentation.*

   Surfaces: `freecode trace` (a `cost` line, omitted entirely when nothing is priced),
   `freecode eval` (a per-run estimate), `--compare` (a reported-not-gated cost row,
   omitted when either side is unpriced), and OTLP `gen_ai.usage.cost`.
2. **Export is manual.** ❌ **Not built — deliberately deferred, needs a decision.** This
   item proposes reversing `2026-08-10-agent-observability.md` §7, which defers live
   streaming for a stated reason, and it puts a network call into the path of a normal
   run. Both are the kind of change that should be chosen rather than inherited from a
   sub-bullet of an LLMOps close-out. The other three items are complete without it.
   `freecode trace <id> --otlp` is post-mortem and opt-in. The
   observability spec §7 already defers live streaming; an `FREECODE_OTLP_ENDPOINT` that
   ships each session's spans on turn end — still from the log, never from the hot path —
   would make Langfuse a live view rather than an archive. Langfuse ingests OTLP/HTTP JSON
   on `/api/public/otel`, which is exactly what `otlp.ts` already emits.
3. **Span coverage stops below the agent.** ✅ **Built 2026-08-27.** The root span is now
   `invoke_agent` with `gen_ai.operation.name`/`gen_ai.agent.name`, and every span —
   root, model, tool — carries `gen_ai.conversation.id = sessionId`, so a session renders
   as one tree. Session-level token totals and cost ride on the root.
   `otlp.ts` emits model spans; the GenAI
   conventions now also cover agent orchestration and MCP tool calls. Adding an
   `invoke_agent` root span per session and setting `gen_ai.conversation.id = sessionId`
   makes a multi-turn session render as one tree instead of N unrelated calls.
4. **Eval results should themselves be spans.** ✅ **Built 2026-08-27** as `eval/otlp.ts`
   + `freecode eval --otlp [url]`. The conventions include a quality evaluation layer, so
   a gate run can ship to the same collector as the runs it graded — scores and traces in
   one place, no second UI.

   The load-bearing part is the **link**, which required `TrialResult.sessionId`: each
   case span links to the trace of the session it graded, using the same
   `hexId(sessionId)` derivation, so a red case in Langfuse is one click from the
   trajectory that failed. Without it, scores and runs arrive as two unrelated sets of
   spans in one collector — most of the value gone. Verified end-to-end against a local
   collector: the emitted link matched the session's own trace and root span ids exactly.

   Three judgement calls: a **quarantined** failure is `STATUS_OK`, because it ran, was
   reported, and by design cannot turn the build red — colouring it red recreates the
   noise quarantine exists to remove. Flakiness (`consistent`) is a separate attribute
   from the verdict, because majority-of-N is the blocking statistic and all-N is not.
   And **no text is exported**: a case carries a prompt and a failure reason can quote
   arguments, so only names, verdicts and numbers go on the wire — the collector may be
   third-party, and §5.2's property has to hold here too.

   One bug this surfaced, caught by a test asserting the wrong thing and then re-read:
   `attrs()` rounds every numeric attribute to an integer, which is right for tokens and
   milliseconds and **silently catastrophic** for a rate — a 50% suite pass rate exported
   as `1`. Cost had the same problem in the other direction (every call `$0`). Both are
   now in an explicit `FRACTIONAL` set rather than relying on a name suffix.

Pin this caveat with them: **`gen_ai.*` is still marked "Development", not Stable**, as of
mid-2026. Core chat and embedding attributes are safe to build dashboards on; the agent
and tool-orchestration attributes above are provisional and may be renamed.
`OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` exists for dual-emission during such a rename.

## 13. Deferred

- **Agent-as-judge** with dynamic rubrics over the full trajectory. Stronger than a fixed
  judge prompt on long-horizon tasks, and materially more expensive. Revisit when the
  judged suite is large enough that fixed-rubric ceilings actually bite.
- **Memory / retrieval evals** — waku ships a `memory_arena.json` for this. FreeCode's
  memory graph (`memory/graph/`) is a bigger surface and deserves its own dataset, keyed
  off `2026-07-26-memory-knowledge-graph.md`, not a subsection here.
- **Multi-provider matrix runs.** Cheap to add once §11 Phase 1 lands (loop the pinned
  model), but a matrix is a model comparison, and §2 says that is not this harness's job.
- **Container isolation.** The correct answer for untrusted cases and the only thing that
  actually sandboxes an agent holding `bash` (§6.3). Not adopted now because Tier 1 tmpdir
  cases do not need it; required before this harness ever runs a case it did not author.
- **Red teaming.** Adversarial prompt suites are a real need for the permission layer
  (`permission/rules.ts`) and a different spec.

## 14. Known gaps and open questions

- **Deterministic evals still cost money.** They drive real model calls, so "deterministic"
  means *the scoring is deterministic*, not the run. Budget accordingly: a pinned cheap
  model and ~20 cases keeps a full Phase 1 gate in the cents, and `--trials 3` triples it.
- **The initial baseline has to come from somewhere.** §9.2 gates on delta against a
  recorded baseline, but the first run has no baseline. Bootstrap is: run the suite 3×,
  record the median pass count, quarantine anything below 0.9, and treat *that* as run
  zero. Until ~20 runs of history exist, §9.3's promotion/demotion rates are computed on
  thin data and should be read as advisory.
- **`.freecode/settings.json` inheritance is undecided.** A sandbox inherits the repo's
  settings, including permission rules and hooks, which is usually right and occasionally
  the thing under test. Needs a decision before Tier 2 (§6.2); Tier 1 tmpdir cases dodge it
  by not being inside the repo.
- **The judge threshold (3.5/5) and the per-case floor (2/5) are both guesses.** They
  should be set from the first real run of the judged suite. They are written down so the
  gate is implementable, not because the numbers are known. **Measured 2026-08-29 — see
  §14.1. Deliberately left unchanged.**

### 14.1 Calibration run, 2026-08-29

The bootstrap this section asks for was run: all three gate suites, `--trials 3`, on
`minimax/MiniMax-M3`, judge `gemini/gemini-3.6-flash`. All three opened the gate —
trajectory 20/21, coding 11/11, judged 6/6 — and those are now the recorded baselines.

**Quarantine is populated** (three entries), and populating it turned up a defect in the
mechanism. `--quarantine-report` proposed seven trajectory cases; **four were rejected**,
because `proposeQuarantine` computes a pass rate over the whole of `eval_runs.jsonl` and
has *no notion of a scoring epoch*. `read-named-file`, `read-respects-path-arg`,
`read-to-summarise` and `find-symbol-uses-grep` each gained an `expectFirstToolIn` on
2026-08-29, so their 80–87% is a rate under scoring that no longer exists — and all four
ran 3/3 under the current rules. **A rate spanning a scoring change is not a rate of
anything**, and the report gives a reader no way to see that it happened. Recording it
here rather than fixing it: the fix wants a scoring-version stamp on `SuiteReport`, which
is baseline substrate and deserves its own decision.

**The judged distribution, over 18 trials:**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| min / max | 4 / 5 |
| mean | 4.61 |
| stdev (per trial) | 0.49 |
| distribution | seven 4s, eleven 5s |
| worst case mean | 4.00 (`explain-a-module`) |
| max spread within a case | 1 point |

**Both thresholds are left as they are, on purpose.** The reasoning, so the next person
does not have to redo it:

- **The mean floor (3.5) has ~1.1 of slack** against an observed 4.61. With 18 trials the
  standard error of the suite mean is ≈0.12, so the floor sits roughly nine standard
  errors below the observation — it cannot fire on noise, and equally it cannot fire until
  quality has fallen a long way. A floor of 4.0 would be defensible on this data.
- **The per-case floor (2) currently cannot fire.** Nothing has ever scored below 4, and
  judge noise within a case is at most 1 point. Its job — *one catastrophic case blocks
  even when the mean is fine* — is real: one case dropping to 2 moves the mean of six only
  to 4.17, which clears 3.5. But at 2 it is set too low to do that job.
- **And yet: n = 1.** A threshold set from a single run is still a guess, just one with a
  number attached. Both figures move the gate in the direction of *more* blocking, and a
  false red is how a gate gets ignored.

**Decision rule, so this does not stay open forever:** after three more judged runs on the
same judge model, if the per-trial minimum has stayed ≥ 4, set the mean floor to 4.0 and
the per-case floor to 3. If any trial has scored below 4 by then, keep both and record
what produced it. Whoever does this should check `SuiteReport.judge` first — the numbers
above are for `gemini-3.6-flash`, and a judge model change invalidates them.
- **`expect_in_args` on structured arguments is underspecified.** Substring matching over
  `String(args[key])` degrades badly when the value is an object or array — `$eq` and
  `$regex` cover the cases that matter today, but a case needing "this array contains this
  element" has no clean spelling yet.
