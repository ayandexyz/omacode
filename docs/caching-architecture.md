## Tier Model

The runtime has two independent tiers, each with its own purpose and invalidation discipline:

| Tier | Lifetime | Invalidated by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Provider-side** | one model request → next request on the same prefix | the next request's prompt prefix changing | cut input-token cost (Anthropic charges ~10% for cached tokens) |
| **Agent-side** | one session, or one process boot | explicit event from the loop, or TTL fallback | skip recomputing things that haven't changed |

The two tiers are deliberately decoupled: a provider-side cache hit is
observable only by what the SDK reports back in usage; an agent-side cache
hit is observable only by what the loop *doesn't* recompute. Mixing them
(e.g. caching the rendered prompt locally) buys nothing the provider cache
doesn't already buy, and risks divergence if the agent-side copy is stale.

## Tier 1 — Provider-side cache

Lives in `apps/core/src/providers/`. Stamps breakpoint markers onto the
outgoing `ModelMessage[]` so Anthropic (and Anthropic-shaped gateways) can
cache the prefix on the upstream side. We never store the prefix
ourselves; the upstream provider does, keyed on the bytes of the prompt.

### 1.1 Breakpoint placement — `utils.ts:146 applyMessageCaching`

Two anchors per request:

- **Write anchor** on the last message (the tail), so the full prefix of
  *this* request is stored for next time.
- **Read anchor** on the message immediately before the newest assistant
  message, i.e. exactly where the previous request ended.

A single marker on the tail alone only ever describes a prefix the model
has never seen — it writes but never reads. The previous request ended at
a different point than where opencode's `.slice(-2)` rule lands because
the AI SDK v6 expands one logical turn into two messages (`assistant` +
`tool`), so the read anchor has to be one further back. See the comment
block on `utils.ts:131-142` for the measured rationale; on MiniMax-M3
that rule pinned reads at ~7K (the system prefix) while input grew to
81K, never scaling with history. The naive `.slice(-2)` version left
reads at 0 even on identical prefixes.

**The ephemeral tail** (`ExecuteOptions.ephemeralTail`, appended by
`generic-provider.ts appendEphemeralTail`). Mutable per-turn state —
memory recalls, the todo list, drained `<system-reminder>`s — is
appended as a final user message *after* the anchors are placed, so it
never carries a breakpoint and the write anchor stays on the last real
message. It used to live in session system blocks, where any change
between inner-loop requests re-sent the entire conversation at full
price (system precedes every message in the prefix; reads collapsed to
the ~12K static block). At the tail it costs only its own tokens.
Measured on MiniMax-M3 after the move: reads track the previous
request's full input near token-exact, 83% cached across the trajectory
suite. `FREECODE_EPHEMERAL_TAIL=0` reverts to the old placement — it
exists only so `eval ab` can price the two placements side by side.

### 1.2 Multi-provider `providerOptions` table — `utils.ts:115`

One marker, five providers:

```ts
const CACHE_PROVIDER_OPTIONS = {
  anthropic:        { cacheControl: { type: "ephemeral" } },
  openrouter:       { cacheControl: { type: "ephemeral" } },
  openaiCompatible: { cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" } },
  alibaba:          { cacheControl: { type: "ephemeral" } },
  bedrock:          { cachePoint:     { type: "default"   } },
} as const;
```

The AI SDK routes `providerOptions` by key and ignores the rest, so
setting them all costs nothing and means a request reached through
OpenRouter or an OpenAI-compatible gateway caches identically to a
direct Anthropic one. Bedrock uses its own shape (`cachePoint`).

### 1.3 Tool-array caching — `utils.ts:46 buildToolsParam`

The last tool's `providerOptions` gets the same marker, so the entire
`{ name, description, parameters }` array caches as one block. Without
this, the cached system prompt sits *above* an uncached tool array, and
the whole tools section re-bills at full price on every turn.

### 1.4 System-block caching — `utils.ts:62 buildAnthropicSystemParam`

When a `SystemBlock.cache === true`, the block is wrapped with
`providerOptions.anthropic.cacheControl`. The prompt compiler sets
`cache: true` only on the static half of the system prompt — the part
that doesn't change between turns. See `context/compiler.ts` for which
blocks qualify.

### 1.5 Cold-cache warning — `providers/cache-awareness.ts`

Anthropic's prompt cache has a ~5-minute TTL by default. If more than
that elapses between turns, the next request re-reads the full context
as fresh input — real money on long contexts. The cold line tracks
`getCacheTtl()` (see 1.7), so under `FREECODE_CACHE_TTL=1h` the warning
fires at 60 minutes rather than 5; at `5m` the message names the knob.

- `noteSendAndCheckCold(sessionId, provider, now?)` — returns a
  warning string when this send will likely miss, `null` otherwise.
  First send of a session returns `null` (nothing was cached yet).
- `summarizeCache(usage)` — computes
  `{ readTokens, writeTokens, hitRatio }` from `cacheReadInputTokens`
  and `cacheCreationInputTokens`, surfaced on the `cache_status` event.
- `disposeCacheAwareness(sessionId)` — drops the per-session timestamp
  on session close.
- `CACHING_PROVIDERS = new Set(["anthropic"])` — OpenAI/Gemini caching
  is either automatic-without-TTL-signal or absent here, so no warning
  is surfaced.

### 1.5a Session cache accounting — `providers/cache-miss.ts`

What the TUI's status-row cache readout shows (`apps/tui/src/components/context-status.ts`; a top-right overlay until 2026-09-27),
and how each number is produced. Spec: `2026-08-09-cache-observability.md`
§D2 / §D2.2; jcode's original is `crates/jcode-tui/src/tui/info_widget.rs`
(`CacheHitInfo`) + `app.rs` (`record_completed_stream_cache_usage`).

**Inputs.** After every model call `loop.ts emitCacheWarm` feeds
`checkCacheUsage(sessionId, sample)` one sample:

| Field | Source | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `inputTokens` | `usage.inputTokens` | The AI SDK's **inclusive** prompt total: non-cached + cache read + cache write. (jcode has to reconstruct this per provider — `effective_prompt_tokens` — because Anthropic's raw `input_tokens` is the uncached remainder; the SDK already normalises it for us.) |
| `cacheReadTokens` | `usage.cacheReadInputTokens` | Served from the provider cache. |
| `cacheWriteTokens` | `usage.cacheWriteInputTokens` ?? `cacheCreationInputTokens` | Written to the cache this call. |
| `provider`, `model` | the call | For switch detection. |
| `turn` | `{ run: loop.runIndex, call: state.turnCount + 1 }` | `run` is the 1-based user-prompt ordinal (never reset — the accounting is per session), `call` the model call within it. Rendered `run.call>` (`3>` when `call` is 1). |

A sample with `read == 0 && write == 0` is a provider that is not caching
(Gemini, most OpenAI-compatible endpoints): it clears the baseline and
contributes to nothing, so absent data never looks like a miss and the widget
falls back to the plain `cache N%` line the TUI derives from `result.usage`.

**Per-call derived values.**

```
promptTokens  = max(inputTokens, read + write)   # a provider omitting inputTokens still said what it cached
cachedPrefix  = read + write                     # what is provably in the cache after this call
optimal       = previous.promptTokens            # what the PREVIOUS call made cacheable
                                                 # (undefined on the first call, and after a
                                                 #  compaction generation bump — see below)
```

`cachedPrefix` is the tighter number and drives miss *detection*;
`promptTokens` is jcode's denominator and drives *yield*. They differ on
Anthropic only by whatever sits after the last breakpoint, which
`applyMessageCaching` (1.1) keeps to the final user message.

**Session totals** (`Totals`, keyed by session id) accumulate
`promptTokens`, `readTokens`, `optimalTokens`, plus the last call's three.
`getCacheStats()` turns them into the wire shape (`CacheStats` in
`packages/shared/src/ipc/protocol.ts`, every ratio a rounded 0–100 integer,
clamped):

| Field | Formula | Widget label |
|---|---|---|
| `yieldPct` | Σ read ÷ Σ optimal | `yield` — undefined (renders `priming`) until a same-generation previous call exists |
| `lastYieldPct` | last read ÷ last optimal | not shown; picks the colour |
| `lastPct` | last read ÷ last promptTokens | `last` |
| `sessionPct` | Σ read ÷ Σ promptTokens | `session` |
| `misses` | bounded list, oldest first | `miss attribution` |

Why the denominator matters: a new user message is *never* in the previous
prompt, so it lowers `last`/`session` (the cost view) without touching `yield`
(the health view). That is why `yield` sits at ~100% in a healthy session while
`session` drifts with how much the user types, and why one bad `yield` sample
is worth looking at when `session` alone would hide it.

**Colour** (`healthPaint`): the freshest signal available —
`lastYieldPct ?? lastPct ?? yieldPct ?? sessionPct` — at jcode's thresholds:
red < 25, yellow < 60, blue < 85, green otherwise.

**Miss attribution.** With a same-generation baseline present:

```
missedTokens = previous.cachedPrefix − read
if missedTokens < 1_024: not a miss           # MIN_MISSED_TOKENS, jcode's threshold
```

Otherwise the shortfall is classified in this order and the first match wins:

| Reason | Test | `harnessBug` | Alarm |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<journal source>: <detail>` | `findRecentInvalidation()` has an entry ≤ 60 s old (`compaction`, `system prompt changed`) | no | no |
| `provider switch` | `sample.provider !== previous.provider` | no | no |
| `model switch` | `sample.model !== previous.model` | no | no |
| `expired` | provider is `anthropic` and `now − previous.completedAt > TTL` (`getCacheTtl()`: 5 m / 1 h) | no | no |
| *(held)* | none of the above — parked as a `PendingMiss` for one sample (§D2.1) | | |
| `provider blip` | the **next** call's read ≥ the pre-miss `cachedPrefix`: the prefix bytes cannot have changed | no | no |
| `harness: zero read` | held, not recovered, and the miss call read 0 | **yes** | `cache_status: miss` |
| `harness: prefix rewritten` | held, not recovered, read > 0 | **yes** | `cache_status: miss` |

A held sample is listed only when its verdict lands, i.e. one call late; a
pending miss with no follow-up (session end, generation bump, provider
stopped reporting) is dropped as unverifiable. `MAX_MISS_SAMPLES` is 12; the
widget draws the newest 5 and folds the rest into `… N more`.

**Compaction.** `bumpCacheGeneration()` (called from `loop.ts` when the
provider-facing history is rebuilt) increments the session's generation and
deletes the baseline. The rebuild turn therefore has no `optimal` (excluded
from yield) and no miss judgement — the drop compaction *must* cause is never
reported as one. The next call re-establishes the baseline.

**Transport.** `getCacheStats()` rides `cache_status.stats` on every `warm`
and `miss` event; the TUI stores the latest and re-renders. Core computes
every ratio, the frontend only draws. `FREECODE_CACHE_MISS_NOTICES=0` gates
only the `miss` alarm — the accounting runs regardless. `resetCacheTracking()`
in `session/end-session.ts` drops all of it when the session ends.

**Not ported from jcode.** Per-request signature hashing (system/tools/messages
hashes → *which* message index changed), so `harness: prefix rewritten` says
*that* the prefix moved, not where; `FREECODE_DEBUG_CACHE=1` (1.6) is the
manual route to that answer.

### 1.6 Per-segment debug hashing — `utils.ts:93 debugSegment`

`FREECODE_DEBUG_CACHE=1` writes a per-segment length + 32-bit content
hash to stderr. A read only happens when the whole prefix up to a
breakpoint is byte-identical, so when the hit rate drops the question is
always "which segment moved?" — and counters can't answer it. Comparing
the hash lines across two consecutive turns answers it directly:
whichever hash changed is the one breaking the prefix.

Output goes to stderr, not stdout: core speaks JSON-RPC over stdout,
so anything `console.log`'d there is swallowed by the frontend's
protocol reader and never reaches the user. stderr is the channel the
TUI actually surfaces.

### 1.7 TTL — `FREECODE_CACHE_TTL`

`utils.ts getCacheTtl()` resolves `5m` (default) or `1h`, read per call
and applied to all three Anthropic-shaped breakpoint kinds at once —
messages, the tools array, and the cached system block. A mixed set
would expire the prefix piecemeal, which is worse than either TTL alone.

At `5m` the `ttl` field is **omitted entirely** rather than sent as
`"5m"`. That is already the server-side default, so the default path
stays byte-identical to what shipped before the knob existed: existing
caches cannot be invalidated by upgrading, and there is no new field for
a gateway to reject.

**When `1h` wins.** The write rate goes 1.25x → 2x base, but per-turn
writes are small — Anthropic bills cache creation for the *delta* once
the head of the prefix hits. What dominates is how often the whole
context is re-written from cold, and at `5m` that is every pause longer
than a coffee refill. One such gap per hour already pays for it (2x once
beats 1.25x twice), and a session with a human reading diffs in the loop
has many. The reverse case is equally real: a fast unattended run with
no gaps pays 2x for durability it never uses. Hence a knob, not a new
default.

**Provider coverage.** `ttl` rides only on the `anthropic` and
`openrouter` keys — the AI SDK's own zod schema for the former
(`@ai-sdk/anthropic` `dist/index.d.ts:195`, `"5m" | "1h"`), OpenRouter's
documented Anthropic `cache_control` passthrough for the latter.
`openaiCompatible` is a raw passthrough to whatever gateway sits behind
it (MiniMax, Z.ai), so an unrecognised field there risks a 400 on the
primary path to buy nothing; `bedrock`'s `cachePoint` has no TTL concept.
**MiniMax's cache lifetime is therefore not controllable from here.**

## Tier 2 — Agent-side cache

Lives in `apps/core/src/` outside `providers/`. All local resources
the loop would otherwise re-read or re-compute on every turn. Six
distinct caches; four use a process-local `Map`, one is on disk, one is
the cross-turn file-content cache inside `SessionStore`.

### 2.1 Project context (file tree + git HEAD) — `context/tree-cache.ts`

```ts
const cache = new Map<string, { ctx: ProjectContext; timestamp: number }>();
const TTL_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000;
```

- **Key**: `projectPath` (absolute).
- **Value**: `{ name, projectPath, tree, gitHead }`.
- **TTL**: 5 minutes (safety net).
- **Invalidation**:
  - Event-driven — `invalidateProjectContext(projectPath)` is called by
    the loop after any mutating tool (`write`, `edit`, `bash`, `agent`).
  - `context/tree-watcher.ts` also invalidates when external writes
    happen — chokidar watches depth-0 + `.git/HEAD`, debounced 200ms.
    Edits inside files don't matter (the cached shape only depends on
    the top-level entry list and git HEAD), so those are ignored.

The watcher is best-effort: if chokidar is unavailable, it silently
degrades to the TTL. It uses `persistent: false` deliberately — the
server is held open by stdio anyway, and `persistent: true` would hang
short-lived processes (tests, one-shot CLI) instead of exiting cleanly.

### 2.2 File-tree strategy — `context/compiler.ts:55 fileTreeCache`

A second, narrower cache layered on top of `tree-cache`. Keyed by the
tuple `(projectPath, gitHead, ignorePatterns)` so it auto-invalidates on
commit without explicit bookkeeping. Used by the file-tree prompt
strategy to assemble the per-section block.

### 2.3 Tool definitions — `tools/defs-cache.ts`

```ts
let cached: ProviderToolDef[] | null = null;
```

- **Value**: `[ { name, description, parameters } ]`, sorted by name.
- **Invalidation**: bus subscription to `tools.changed` and
  `mcp.tools.changed`. Also calls `PromptCompiler.clearCaches()` since
  the compiler's file-tree cache is sensitive to tool changes.

Built lazily on first `getToolDefs()` call; subscribes once via
`ensureSubscribed()`. Tools are sent as native schemas now, so only the
compiler's file-tree cache remains; dropping it on a rare tool/skill
change is acceptable.

### 2.4 Repo-map symbols — `repo-map/index.ts`

```ts
const caches = new Map<string, SymbolCache>(); // projectPath → { symbols, gitHead, timestamp }
const TTL_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000;
```

- **Key**: `projectPath`.
- **Value**: `{ symbols, gitHead, timestamp }`.
- **TTL**: 5 minutes.
- **Invalidation**:
  - Auto on git HEAD change (`cached.gitHead !== gitHead`).
  - `invalidateSymbolCache(projectPath?)` on demand (drop one or all).

Single-file lookups parse fresh (cheap); the cache exists for the
whole-project symbol list, which would otherwise dominate the
prompt-compile budget. Single daemon can serve multiple project paths —
each path has its own entry.

### 2.5 Skills — `skills/manager.ts`

Per-project `SkillManager` instance, keyed by project path
(`PER_PROJECT_CACHE` map at the bottom of the file).

- **State**: `registry`, `lastLoadTime`, `cacheTtlMs` (default 5 min,
  configurable per-instance).
- **Invalidation**: `invalidateCache()` — drops the in-memory registry
  without reloading from disk; `reload()` — full reload.
- **Lazy miss path**: a request for a dynamically-added skill that
  isn't in the cache falls through to disk (`skills/loader.ts`) without
  invalidating the rest of the registry. Most skills are static; this
  path is only hit for skills added after boot.

The skill loader scans plugin layouts
(`cache/<mkt>/<plugin>/<ver>/skills`,
`repos/<owner>/<repo>/skills`, ...) — manifest-first, bounded deep scan
as fallback. See `skills/loader.ts:127`.

### 2.6 Model registry — `models-dev.ts`

Two-tier: in-memory + on-disk.

```ts
let cache: { data: Provider[]; timestamp: number } | null = null; // in-memory
const CACHE_FILE = "~/.freecode/cache/models-dev.json";            // on-disk
const CACHE_TTL_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000;
```

- **Read path**: in-memory hit → disk hit → `fetchFromNetwork()`.
- **Write path**: network success writes both layers; network failure
  falls back to disk even if expired (the model registry is preferable
  to a missing-registry crash). `forceRefresh` skips the in-memory
  layer but still consults disk first.

### 2.7 Session file-content cache — `session/store.ts:79 ContextCache`

Persisted as `context-cache.json` inside the session directory. Not a
runtime cache in the same sense as the others — it's a write-through
store of `{ requestedFiles, fileContents, turnCount }` that survives
across process restarts so a resumed session doesn't re-fetch the same
file contents on its first turn after resume.

The store is empty after a fresh resume; the loop degrades to
re-reading the requested files. After the first turn it's warm.

### 2.8 MCP tool catalog — `mcp/service.ts:91`

Per-server `tools: Map<toolName, ToolDef>` on the connected client.
Cache lifetime is the connection lifetime — no TTL. Connections are
created in `mcp/init.ts`, torn down in `mcp/transport.ts`. Changes to
the catalog flow through `bus` `mcp.tools.changed`, which invalidates
`tools/defs-cache.ts` (see 2.3).

### 2.9 Memory graph vector cache — `memory/graph/vector-store.ts`

Content-hash → packed f32 dedupe. Embedding the same content twice
returns the cached vector without a second ONNX inference. No TTL:
embeddings are content-addressed, so a hash collision is the only
invalidation.

---

## What is *not* cached

These are opencode-style mechanisms that freecode deliberately does not
ship. Documented here so future work doesn't re-litigate the decision.

### No `Effect.cached` for in-flight dedupe

Opencode uses `Effect.cachedWithTTL` to collapse concurrent callers of
the same expensive computation onto one in-flight fiber. freecode has no
equivalent. In practice the loop is single-threaded per turn, so two
prompt compiles never race — but if a future feature (parallel tool
results, async UI renderers) ever triggers concurrent
`getToolDefs()` / `getProjectContext()` calls, both will pay the cost
independently. Worth revisiting if a profile shows redundant work.

### No `ScopedCache` for per-project lifecycle

Opencode's `effect/instance-state.ts` keys a `ScopedCache` by directory
and auto-disposes on project close. freecode's TTL-on-`Map` caches
(2.1, 2.4) leak when a project is "closed" — there's no teardown
hook. The CLI is single-process, so the leak is bounded to one
project's worth of state and is released on process exit; the only
scenario where this matters is a long-lived server (`serve` command)
toggling between project directories. Worth revisiting if `serve` grows
multi-project support.

### No LSP layer

Opencode runs language servers for in-editor symbol resolution, hover,
go-to-def, and diagnostic push. freecode's `repo-map` covers a slice of
what an LSP server would give you (whole-project symbol list) but no
per-file AST, no incremental diagnostics, no live type info. Not on the
critical path for the CLI use case; would be needed for IDE integration.

---

## Invalidator map

| Bus event | Caches it invalidates |
|---|---|
| `tools.changed` | `tools/defs-cache` (2.3), `context/compiler` file-tree cache (2.2) |
| `mcp.tools.changed` | `tools/defs-cache` (2.3) |
| Any mutating tool completion | `context/tree-cache` (2.1) for that project |
| `.git/HEAD` change (watcher) | `context/tree-cache` (2.1) |
| Top-level add/unlink (watcher) | `context/tree-cache` (2.1) |
| Git HEAD change | `repo-map` symbol cache (2.4) for that project |

Anything not in this table falls back to its TTL.
