# Changelog

## v0.43.1

ChatGPT subscriptions. `freecode auth login openai` serves the `openai` provider from a ChatGPT Plus/Pro plan through the Codex backend, the same way `freecode auth login anthropic` does for Claude Pro/Max. Also: the Claude subscription login works again on newer models, and a session with an unanswered tool call no longer fails every later request.

### Added

- **ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription for `openai`** (`f3b8d0b8`). `freecode auth login|status|logout openai`: PKCE login with the Codex CLI's client id on `localhost:1455` (paste fallback), requests sent to `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`. The backend only streams and rejects `max_output_tokens` and `temperature`, so the wrapper forces streaming, strips those, and reassembles non-streaming calls from the stream. Opt-in like Anthropic (`providers.openai.authMode`, `FREECODE_OPENAI_AUTH`); an API key on the machine still wins. Subscription calls are recorded with no dollar cost. freecode keeps its own login and never copies `~/.codex/auth.json`, because a shared rotating refresh token logs one program out. Spec: `docs/specs/2026-09-29-openai-codex-oauth-provider.md`; guide: `getting-started/openai-subscription`.
- **Judged commit-reconstruction bench** (`42509041`, `f6db196a`, `171381ea`, `323d6b40`, `8a54c088`, `bab2da29`, `877a957e`, `0fb0bdf4`, `35ef4d7b`): `pnpm bench:commits`, `bench:tasks`, `bench:judge` and `bench:agents --set freecode-commits`. Gemini scores, GPT audits 20%, and a contamination window refuses models released after the task window opens. Operator page: `AGENT-BENCH.md` §3d.
- **Eval cases** (`74a240ba`): AGENTS.md naming the test command, and a real tool call after a compaction summary.
- **CI test guard** (`b4e7b0d7`): fails when core or TUI runs fewer tests or files than `.github/test-baselines.json` records.
- **TUI coverage** (`c67c3597`, `21ddac66`): a tmux end-to-end smoke suite, plus tests for the slash menu, permission prompt, diff view and tool results.

### Fixed

- **Claude subscription on newer models** (`11eab91a`). The Claude Code version freecode reports was bumped from 2.1.257 to 2.1.280; Anthropic now refuses older versions for some models ("Claude Code 2.1.257 does not support this model").
- **A tool call with no recorded result is answered on the wire** (`d0a1478a`). An unanswered `tool_use` is rejected, and history is re-sent every turn, so one orphan (old or hand-edited sessions) failed every later request in a session. It now goes out with a result saying none was recorded.

### Notes

Tests: core 1848/1848, TUI 360/360, typecheck clean. The ChatGPT path was checked live on 2026-09-29: a streamed tool call, a follow-up turn, a non-streaming call and a full `freecode run` turn. The browser login itself has not been run live. Whether a spent ChatGPT usage window is recognised as a quota error is unverified (TODO.md).

## v0.43.0

Overnight runs. `freecode night "<objective>"` works unattended: a loop of short, fresh-session iterations, each ending in a `finish_iteration` call, with the orchestrator — not the model — committing successes to a `night/<slug>` branch and resetting failures. Nothing waits on a human; a spent subscription window is waited out; the morning report leads with what needs you. Alongside it, the model no longer refuses an explicit request to use the `question` tool, and MiniMax and Gemini get small, measured prompt overlays.

### Added

- **`freecode night`** (`966654bd`, `859db0a3`, `82f3c0bc`, `62c7e04c`, `de1364cf`). One limit is required (`--until 07:00`, `--max-iterations N` or `--max-usd N`). Preflight refuses a dirty tree, a non-repo and a detached HEAD; three consecutive failures abort. Questions answer themselves and are recorded; permissions go through a fixed envelope (no git history rewrites, push, publish or sudo; writes only inside the run tree). A guard rail, not a sandbox — what bounds the damage is reset-on-failure plus its own branch. Spec: `docs/specs/2026-09-28-overnight-runs.md`; guide: `guides/overnight-runs`.
  - **Surviving the night:** a spent quota is waited out to its reset (+60s), probed when no reset is stated, capped by `--max-wait` (12h) and `--until`; credits/auth abort. `--fallback-model`, `--verify '<cmd>'` gating each commit, `--stop-when`, and a sleep inhibitor.
  - **The morning:** `freecode night status|report|list|stop [id]`, resolved by id or branch. The report puts needs-you first, then decisions (irreversible first), refusals, waits, commits, diffstat and cost. Running `freecode night` on a `night/*` branch resumes it.
  - **`/night` in the TUI:** a read-only roster; Enter opens the report, `k` asks a running night to stop. A finished run fires the Notification hook.
  - **Detach, schedule, sandbox:** `--detach` / `--at <HH:MM|90m|ISO>` run a detached worker in its own worktree. `--sandbox` (on by default) wraps unattended bash, `--verify` and background shells in bubblewrap. `--worktree`, `--push`, `--commit-style conventional`.
- **Typed loop failures and quota evidence** (`70cf15fe`). `QuotaExhaustedError` (scope, reset time, provider) and `LoopResult.failure`, filled at every exit; `model.error` records rate-limit header names and values.
- **Model-family prompt overlays** (`813210ad`). One canonical system prompt plus a short overlay per family, routed by model id then provider (so gateways resolve too). MiniMax and Gemini ship text; GPT and Kimi are routed but empty until measured. `FREECODE_MODEL_OVERLAY=0` turns them off.
- **`evals/night.jsonl`** (`b806f5e6`): unattended-iteration compliance suite.

### Changed

- **The TUI input sits right under the conversation** (`d4290938`) instead of being pinned to the bottom row; it reaches the bottom once history fills the screen. The notice and jump pill follow it.
- **A headless ask fails fast** (`70cf15fe`). `askQuestion` with no subscriber rejects at once instead of waiting out the 30-minute prompt timeout.

### Fixed

- **An explicit request to use the `question` tool is honoured** (`76bef6b0`). The system prompt reserved the tool for "genuine forks" and MiniMax quoted that back as a refusal; the restraint now applies only when the model decides to ask on its own, and an answer refines the existing request instead of starting new work.
- **Envelope bypasses** (`bfc6c24a`): chained, path-qualified (`/usr/bin/git`) and env-prefixed git commands no longer slip past the deny rules.
- **Bugs from the first live detached runs** (`25be4799`): tools ran in the user's checkout instead of the worktree; failed iterations lost their session id, cost and learnings; the report's review range was hard-coded to `main`; git and home-installed toolchains failed inside the sandbox; MiniMax's garbled nested `finish_iteration` args are untangled.
- **A resumed night requires a limit** (`b85ce1c9`), like a fresh start.
- **Docs deploy** (`d19297e0`, `0ab7858d`): an unanchored `docs` in `.vercelignore` removed `apps/docs` from its own Vercel build.

### Notes

`evals/night.jsonl` on MiniMax-M3: 5/5 cases, `finish_iteration` in 14/15 trials before the live-run fixes and 15/15 after. Overlay A/Bs on the trajectory suite (×5): MiniMax 134 → 139/150 with repeated calls 9 → 2; Gemini 3.6 Flash 127 → 130/150 at −1.2% cost; no majority regressions on either. The question-tool wording measured neutral on MiniMax (the refusal did not reproduce in-eval). Tests: core 1833/1833, TUI 329/329, typecheck clean.

## v0.42.0

Background work. A subagent or a shell no longer has to hold the turn: `agent(run_in_background: true)` and `bash(run_in_background: true)` return at once, and the result comes back as a task notification — steered into the running turn, or starting one if the session is idle. The parent can steer or stop a running subagent, pick its role from Claude Code-format agent files, and continue a finished one. On the memory side, automatic recall is now measured rather than assumed, and the retrieval judge is off by default because the measurement found it neutral.

### Added

- **Background subagents with task notifications** (`6b4a6201`, `0fe104e0`). `agent(run_in_background: true)` returns immediately; the result reaches the spawner as a `synthetic: "task_notification"` user message. Mid-turn it rides `AgentLoop.steer()`; idle, it starts a turn (250ms coalesce). On by default (`tasks.notify`, `FREECODE_TASK_NOTIFY`); off ⇒ background falls back to foreground. `/agents` shows the spawn prompt as the viewer's first message.
- **Background shells notify on exit** (`53b78a0c`). Exit code + 4k tail as a `<task-notification>`, skipped when the model already saw the end (drained via `bashoutput`, or killed it itself).
- **Foreground bash that outlives its timeout moves to the background** (`f05d0a77`) instead of being killed, keeping the output so far. `timeout` is capped at 10 minutes; a model that set a lower timeout itself still gets a kill, now with the partial output and advice.
- **`monitor` tool** (`44fef65a`, `2022a02b`, `05f57aa9`). Runs a command in the background and turns its output lines (or `pattern` matches) into notifications while it runs — batched per second, self-stopping at 20 events or `timeout_ms`. `monitor({ bash_id })` attaches to an already-running shell; its guard rails then detach, never kill.
- **Read-only `agent` calls in one response run concurrently** (`44fef65a`).
- **`agent_send` / `agent_stop`** (`d0b2fa45`). The direct parent steers or cancels a running subagent. A message the subagent never read is listed in its result, never dropped. Spec: `docs/specs/2026-09-27-agent-control-and-definitions.md`.
- **Sub-agent types** (`000a0119`, `c7b81760`). `agent({ subagent_type })` picks a role from Claude Code-format `*.md` files: built-in (general / explorer / reviewer) → `~/.claude/agents` → `~/.freecode/agents` → project `.claude/agents` → project `.freecode/agents`, later wins. A role's `tools` allowlist narrows the mode's tool set, never widens it. `freecode agents list` prints the resolved roster; `/agents` rows show the type. `FREECODE_CLAUDE_CODE_AGENTS=0` skips the `.claude` ones.
- **Continue a finished subagent** (`e05521b3`). `agent({ continue: <id> })` forks its session and runs it with the config recorded at spawn, so it cannot change role or authority. The in-process roster is the lookup, so it does not survive a restart.
- **Background ledger** (`44fef65a`). Background agents, shells and monitors still running when a session ends or the core exits are reported as `lost` on resume, in the next turn — never a turn of their own.
- **Hooks mirror questions, permissions and turn ends into agent-fold** (`526fc511`).
- **Memory cost accounting** (`0300299f`, `6ac1653d`, `fcab5e04`, `07c65d8f`, `1b825553`, `0bf5c0e7`, `0eeed655`). Auxiliary model calls (extraction, judge, consolidation) are recorded and included in trace cost; request-level memory exposure and preparation state are logged.
- **Memory benchmarks and suites** (`dd2083d4`, `3380ae09`, `f135976d`, `b729cc8e`, `b6e05376`, `151d9af5`, `bd364abc`, `edf063c7`). `pnpm bench:inject` scores what the model actually receives; `pnpm eval ab memory` pairs recall on/off; multi-session, consolidation, long-horizon and LongMemEval-S adapted suites. Spec: `docs/specs/2026-09-25-memory-efficiency-and-graph-explorer.md`.
- **Delegation eval suite** (`6bf33ea2`) for agent-tool routing — it found and fixed three harness bugs.

### Changed

- **Memory retrieval judge is off by default** (`04aca9b9`). The fixed judge measured neutral against no judge. Enable with `memory.retrievalJudge: true` or `FREECODE_DISABLE_MEMORY_JUDGE=0`.
- **Context/cache readout moved into the status row** (`b7076a66`) under the input, instead of a top-right overlay that covered conversation text.
- **Turns started by the core** (a notification arriving while idle) get a spinner, interrupt and steering in the TUI (`14ac7ea0`).

### Fixed

- **Rendered memory context is capped** (`37b2a9e7`), and injected memories stay consistent with the store after a save or delete (`d66ceb94`).
- **Query embeddings are no longer padded to 512 tokens** (`21d3bce1`).
- **The retrieval judge works on the first request** (`9c957bb2`).

### Notes

Automatic memory recall measured 23–24/24 vs 12–13/24 without it, at −45% cost per passed task; `memory-sessions` shows learning across sessions, 13/15 vs 4/15 at 3.9% extraction cost. Judged-gate calibration runs on Gemini recorded GATE OPEN (`c0ee3495`). Tests: core 1697/1697, TUI 318/318, typecheck clean.

## v0.41.0

Auto-poke no longer treats a list of suggestions as authorization, and the Omarchy-style `/` menu lands. A status question like "what's left?" became implementation: the model recorded suggested fixes as pending todos and the loop read the open list as a reason to continue. Suggested work was being treated as authorized work. The slash menu gets a card layout that matches the Omarchy theme across `/`, `/model`, and `/web`.

### Added

- **Omarchy-style `/` command menu** (`191fb381`, `6a67db1f`). `/` opens a card layout that matches the Omarchy theme; `/model` and `/web` pick from the same card. Selection highlights the full row.
- **Icons for every `/` menu row** (`3a1c882d`).

### Changed

- **Resume modal follows the Omarchy theme** (`f8549327`).
- **`menu-card` selection band covers the full row** (`2e8f2785`), not just the text. Test de-coupled from a truecolor theme (`f7c83321`).

### Fixed

- **Auto-poke requires in-progress work, not pending suggestions** (`04872aa9`). A status question ("what's left?") had become implementation: the model recorded suggested fixes as pending todos and auto-poke read the open list as a reason to continue. Suggested work was being treated as authorized work. Auto-poke now requires an `in_progress` item; an all-pending list is not a reason to poke. The poke identifies itself as automated and cannot authorize new work; the system prompt and todo guidance separate reporting a gap from filling it. Regression coverage harvested from the recorded session. Tradeoff: an all-pending plan no longer auto-starts.

### Notes

Eval ledger for the included core change: trajectory gate 26/26 at 3 trials, GATE OPEN, no regression across the 27 cases shared with the 2026-09-08 baseline. New cases `tenant-status-report-does-not-implement` and `greeting-with-home-directory-context` both 3/3. Experiment ledger entries `2026-09-24-trajectory-1` and `-redirect-build-1` marked kept.

## v0.40.0

Undo. `/rewind` takes back a turn's file changes and the conversation that caused them, together — the session tree already rewound the transcript and left disk untouched, which made the conversation describe files that were never put back. On Omarchy, switching the OS theme now repaints a running session instead of asking for a restart.

### Added

- **Checkpoints and `/rewind`** (`0d5fe5f`, `6c07076`, `c004330`, `7c3100d`). The working tree is snapshotted once per user turn, and `/rewind` restores a turn's files and moves the conversation leaf back to it. Snapshots are **git trees in a shadow repository** under `~/.freecode/snapshots/<hash>/` whose work tree is the project: the project's own `.git` — index, HEAD, stash, `git status` — is never touched, which `shadow-git.test.ts` pins by asserting the host repo is byte-identical across a capture/restore cycle. Capture costs ~13ms per turn after a one-time ~240ms, and is best-effort: it never fails the turn it was taken for. `/tree` is unchanged and stays conversation-only. Spec: `docs/specs/2026-09-23-checkpoints-rewind.md`.
- **`freecode checkpoint status|gc`** (`f42c88a`). Where the snapshot store lives and how big it is; `gc` prunes it. `gc` discards **every** snapshot, so `/rewind` can no longer restore files for existing sessions — the conversation history is untouched. Pruning is manual on purpose: `git gc` walks every object, and a checkpoint has to cost nothing you can feel.
- **`session.checkpoints` / `session.rewindPreview` / `session.rewind` IPC** (`c004330`). `rewindPreview` returns the exact file list without touching disk, which is what makes the TUI's confirmation meaningful.
- **`checkpoint.captured` / `skipped` / `restored` rollout events** (`4e62e1d`). Ids, counts and durations only — paths never enter the log, because it feeds the OTLP export.

### Changed

- **The TUI follows Omarchy theme changes during a running session** (`c409e9c`). `omarchy-theme-set` notifies nobody, so a theme switch previously meant restarting. The obstacle was not re-reading the theme but the ten call sites that capture paints at module scope; `palette` is now a stable facade whose paints resolve when called, so captured references follow the theme with no consumer changes. The watcher watches the **parent** state directory, not `theme/colors.toml`, because a switch replaces the theme directory and a watch on a file inside it is left on a stale inode and silently never fires again. A failed read keeps the last valid palette, so a half-written theme cannot flash the UI back to the defaults. A user-pinned theme override remains unbuilt.
- **`checkpoints.{enabled,maxPerSession}` settings** (`f42c88a`), `FREECODE_CHECKPOINTS` to override. **On by default**, unlike the loop gates: it does not change what the model does, so the rule about flipping a default only on an `eval ab` delta does not apply.

### Known limitations

- **Checkpoints require a git repository.** `add -A` leans on the project's `.gitignore` to know what not to snapshot; without one the first capture of a Node project would walk `node_modules`. A non-git project logs a line and stays inert rather than failing a turn.
- **A rewind reverts changes the agent did not make.** The restore diffs the snapshot against the current tree, which cannot tell an agent edit from one you made by hand since the checkpoint. Everything changed since the snapshot is reverted. The preview lists every affected path and requires a confirmation, which is the floor rather than the fix; per-tool path tracking is the fix and is not built (spec §9 Q4).
- **Writes outside the project root are not captured or restored** — a `bash` command that edits `~/.config` is outside the snapshot's work tree, and previews as "no file changes".
- **The snapshot store grows and is pruned manually** (~12 MB for a repo this size). `freecode checkpoint gc`.

### Notes

`freecode eval` does not exit after printing its results (`fdb6836`, `6831584`), and because `eval:gate` chains its three suites on `&&`, that stops coding and judged from running at all. `FREECODE_MCP_CLAUDE_CODE=0` is the confirmed workaround and was used to gate this release. Filed in `TODO.md`, not yet fixed.

This release was gated at 25/25 trajectory and 12/12 coding (3 trials each, MiniMax-M3). The judged suite reported 6/6 and a 4.80/5 mean, but only **7 of 18 trials actually scored** — the judge hit its quota mid-run — so treat that number as thin rather than as a quality signal.

## v0.39.0

FreeCode inherits Claude Code's MCP servers, and the launch path stops waiting on the network. The update check and the MCP connect both moved off startup, taking time-to-input-ready from ~1.0s to ~0.46s against a 0.37s floor.

### Added

- **Claude Code's MCP servers are imported** (`3ee7526`). `mcp/claude-code-config.ts` reads `~/.claude.json` (user and per-project entries) and `<cwd>/.mcp.json`, translating them into `McpServer` and expanding `${VAR:-default}`. They merge *after* FreeCode's own entries, so a same-named FreeCode server wins. `source: "claude-code"` flows through `mcp.status`: the picker labels them, `freecode mcp list` shows `claude`, and `freecode mcp remove` refuses them and points at `claude mcp remove` instead. `FREECODE_MCP_CLAUDE_CODE=0` turns the whole thing off.
- **Skills and plugins in the header** (`3ee7526`). The logo header's stats line reads Tools / MCP / Skills / Plugins, fed by a new `plugins.list` IPC and a public `listInstalledPlugins()` in the skills loader.

### Changed

- **The update check no longer blocks launch** (`4f1682e`). `entry.ts` awaited a GitHub round-trip before importing the TUI — ~1.1s of blank terminal every launch, up to 3s when GitHub was slow. It now runs after the first frame, is never awaited, and only reports: a line under the version reading `update available (vX.Y.Z) · run freecode update`. The old path installed and re-exec'd on its own; that is gone, so `freecode update` is the only thing that updates you. Consequence worth knowing: launching an old binary from `builds/versions/<old>/` now keeps you there, and `FREECODE_NO_UPDATE` only silences the notice rather than pinning a version.
- **The daemon no longer waits on MCP to start** (`3742595`). `initMcpServers()` was awaited before core read a single stdin line, so the frontend's first `tools.list`, `mcp.status` and `skills.list` all queued behind the slowest server — ~3s for one backend probe. Connection now happens in the background; `session.send` still awaits it so the first turn sees every MCP tool, and headless `run`/`eval` keep awaiting. The TUI fires its four header requests in one batch instead of two rounds.
- **Repo hygiene for a public release** (`188ceaa`). Stray root files moved under `docs/` (papers, screenshots, notes), install scripts and doc links repointed at `ayandexyz/omacode` — the old `ayandexyz/freecode` URL only worked through GitHub's rename redirect — and root `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `SECURITY.md` added.
- **The backlog is three files** (`c44639c`). `TODO.md` is debt that must reach zero before 1.0, `ROADMAP.md` is unbuilt features needing a spec, and `docs/DECISIONS.md` is deliberate behaviour that must not be "fixed".

### Fixed

- **An MCP server's startup banner no longer looks like a FreeCode error** (`a28fb6f`). `StdioClientTransport` defaulted to `stderr: "inherit"`, so a server's own notices were printed on core's stderr and rendered by the TUI as if FreeCode had failed. They go to `~/.freecode/logs/mcp/<name>.log` instead; `FREECODE_DEBUG=1` still echoes them.
- **The update-check endpoint** (`4f1682e`). It pointed at `ayandexyz/freecode`, which has answered `301 -> ayandexyz/omacode` since the rename, costing a redirect round-trip on a request made once per launch.
- **Confidence spikes are counted as the loop recorded them** (`6e98db7`). Two fold bugs in `bench/harness-signals`: spike flags never resolved, because `todo.signal` is recorded *after* the `function.call` it diffed and so landed one event too late to read inline; and `aggregate` discarded the recorded tally to recompute `completed - assigned >= 40`, which spans an item's whole life and counts a legitimate 50 → 70 → 95 climb as a spike. Refreshes `signals.json` over 5,313 sessions — the published file was a stale 8-session window showing zeros.
- **Todo UI** (`ecbd6f7`).

## v0.38.0

The TUI grows jcode's KV cache widget and jcode's composer. The top-right corner now says whether the harness is reusing its own prompt cache and which turn lost what; the input loses its box and gains the branch name.

### Added

- **Cache yield and miss attribution** (`f303172`). The top-right widget shows `yield · last · session` — yield is cache reads over what the *previous* request made cacheable (harness health, unaffected by what you type), last/session are reads over prompt (cost) — plus a `miss attribution` list labelling every shortfall ≥1,024 tokens as `run.call>`, tokens re-sent, and why: a journal entry (`compaction: …`), `provider switch`, `model switch`, `expired`, `provider blip`, or the two red `harness:` reasons that are real bugs. Core computes everything (`providers/cache-miss.ts` → `cache_status.stats`); the widget is 46 columns and hides under 90. Documented in the Usage & cost guide and `docs/caching-architecture.md` §1.5a.
- **Branch in the prompt** (`64b1efd`). The composer prefix is the git branch (`main> `), falling back to the turn number outside a repo.

### Changed

- **Borderless composer** (`3b641a8`, `f9afb81`). The boxed input is replaced with jcode's: a labelled prompt whose colour says what Enter will do, and a dim status row underneath. Returns four columns and two rows to the transcript. Shell and command modes keep the plain `>`.
- **User messages get their own background** (`246f33f`, `40af6e8`), with a blank row below so the borderless composer does not touch the last message.

### Fixed

- **A mid-session model switch is no longer a false prompt-cache miss alarm** (`f303172`). The D2 detector attributes it as `model switch` instead of holding it and then reporting an unexplained rewrite. `FREECODE_CACHE_MISS_NOTICES=0` now mutes only the alarm; the accounting keeps running.

## v0.37.0

A bare `hi` from the home directory made MiniMax-M3 read `dev.sh`, follow it into an unrelated project and invent a task. The project context is now framed as background, not a request, and the eval harness that measured the fix grew durable reports and stricter no-tool scoring.

### Changed

- **Project context is framed as background, not a task** (`0c1124e`). The position-0 context message is wrapped in a `<system-reminder>` stating it is supplied by FreeCode and not a user request; `system.md` drops "maximally proactive" and says a greeting gets a conversational reply. `FREECODE_CONTEXT_FRAMING=legacy` restores the old framing for `eval ab`. Measured four times on the full trajectory suite (ledger `2026-09-21-trajectory-1…5`): greeting-over-home-tree 1/3 → 3/3 on every run, no exploration case regressed; `frustrated-user-wants-one-line`, a registered known gap, dipped in two runs.

### Fixed

- **Eval A/B reports are durable** (`c30f394`). Every run saves a full report to `~/.freecode/eval-ab/<uuid>.json` (per-trial results, session ids, resolved models, commit, dirty flag, tree hash); the ledger links to it. `expectTool: null` now fails on attempted and denied calls, and the CLI lists every raw pass-count decline, including ones the majority label calls unchanged.
- **`find-symbol-uses-grep` uses an isolated fixture** (`c30f394`). Its old symbol was named in `CLAUDE.md`, so "called nothing" was the model reading the instructions, not skipping the search.

## v0.36.0

A TUI-only release: the terminal UI follows the Omarchy theme, and the in-progress row gets the Claude Code shimmer. Nothing in `apps/core` changed, so the eval gate was not run; `apps/tui` tests are 262/262.

### Added

- **Omarchy-aware palette** (`f64b2f7`, `db93300`, `8f7168e`, `3ac29c2`). `utils/omarchy-theme.ts` resolves the active Omarchy theme's `colors.toml` in one call and `palette.ts` maps it onto semantic names (`accent`, `muted`, `fg`, the eight ANSI hues, chip/diff backgrounds, syntax colours). Every component paints through the palette — no `chalk.yellow` / `chalk.hex` left in components — so on Omarchy the whole TUI follows the theme and everywhere else the look is the chalk defaults it shipped with.
- **Shimmer on the working phrase** (`3c90418`, `utils/shimmer.ts`). The in-progress row's phrase ("Pondering", …) is painted in a resting tone with a soft highlight sweeping left to right, Claude Code style. Theme-aware (`palette.shimmer`), band position derived from the clock so it needs no timer of its own; the message list's in-progress tick is 100 ms instead of 1 s while the row is on screen.

### Changed

- **Logo is OmaCode** (`bb7d4e9`, `9daee81`, `56b5770`, `a622df5`), themed off Omarchy's accent, with breathing room above it and between it and the `>_ OmaCode (vX)` line.
- **In-progress row drops the context meter** (`d0b3a72`). It reads `phrase (Ns) ↓in ↑out cached: N (xN)`; context occupancy lives in the `/context` overlay.

## v0.35.0

The pi parity release plus two harness fixes found by folding the rollout logs. Six pi features land: mid-turn steering, a prompt-cache warmer, an in-place session tree with `/tree`, fuzzy edit matching, in-process TypeScript extensions, and `!cmd` / Ctrl+G / `SYSTEM.md` ergonomics (spec `docs/specs/2026-09-20-pi-parity-plan.md`). The todo nudge was writing the todo lists — 45% of first lists in 2,553 sessions were made on the exact turn the harness asked — and is now at Claude Code's 10/10 with its wording. Auto-poke no longer sends a read-only turn back to work and gives a prose-only reply one harder re-poke. Release gate: trajectory 24/24 open, coding 12/12 open; judged ran but the Gemini judge was out of quota, so it graded nothing (re-run before the next release).

### Added

- **Mid-turn steering** (`7cfa934`). `session.send` with `streamingBehavior: "steer"` while a turn is busy hands the prompt to `AgentLoop.steer()`; it is delivered as a persisted `synthetic: "steer"` user message between one tool batch and the next model call. TUI: Enter steers, Alt+Enter queues a follow-up. `FREECODE_STEERING_MODE=all` delivers every pending steer at once.
- **Prompt-cache warmer** (`00e63dd`, `providers/cache-warmer.ts`). Replays the run's last request with `maxTokens: 1` at 90% of the Anthropic TTL when the expected saving is ≥ $0.05; recorded as `cache.warm`, never as a model turn. **Off by default** (`cache.warming` / `FREECODE_CACHE_WARMING=idle`); Anthropic only — MiniMax's implicit cache has no TTL to reset.
- **Session tree** (`85fbad6`). `messages.jsonl` is a tree with zero migration: `parentId` is written only on the first append after `navigate()`, so a session that never branches is byte-identical. `getMessages()` returns the active path, so every reader got the tree for free. `/tree` in the TUI, `session.tree|navigate|label` IPC, an abandoned branch becomes a `synthetic: "branch_summary"` message. `/fork` = new session from the active path.
- **Fuzzy edit matching** (`fa730d4`). `edit` matches typographic quotes and dashes against ASCII and back (`unicodeNormalizedReplacer`), so a model that pastes `"` for `"` no longer fails the edit.
- **Extensions** (`6ac1824`, `extensions/`). `~/.freecode/extensions/*.ts` exporting `(api) => …` with `registerTool` / `registerCommand` / `on(event)`; project extensions need `extensions.trustedProjects`. `/extensions`, `/reload`; `FREECODE_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS=1`. Example in `docs/examples/extensions/hello.ts`.
- **`!cmd` / `!!cmd`, Ctrl+G, `SYSTEM.md`** (`055d350`). `!cmd` runs a shell command through core's bash tool and submits the output as the next prompt, `!!cmd` only shows it; Ctrl+G opens `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` on the prompt buffer; `SYSTEM.md` replaces the shipped system prompt and `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` composes onto it, project `.freecode/` over `~/.freecode/`, re-read every turn.
- **Prompt variants for `eval ab`** (`0718c2c`). `FREECODE_SYSTEM_FILE` (replacement) and `FREECODE_APPEND_SYSTEM_FILE` (append) are read every turn and allowlisted, so a prompt edit is A/B'd per side without touching `system.md`. Candidates and their verdicts live in `evals/prompt-variants/`.

### Changed

- **Todo nudge at Claude Code's thresholds** (`3be0357`, `agent/reminders.ts`). The "you have not used todowrite recently" reminder fired after 3 turns and every 5 after — the most aggressive of any harness compared (opencode, codex and pi have none). Reconstructing the counters over 10,377 turns: a turn with no list wrote one 1.8% of the time unprompted and 36.7% of the time when nudged. Now 10 turns since the last write, at most every 10, in CC's "gentle reminder — ignore if not applicable" wording; with a list present it asks for cleanup rather than a plan. `FREECODE_TODO_NUDGE=legacy` restores 3/5 for `eval ab`. A/B vs legacy on MiniMax-M3: coding 12/12 unchanged-pass, turns 186→178, tokens −5.5%; 8-case trajectory subset 0 regressed, 1 improved.
- **Poke text leads with the action** (`ba4d529`). The second line led with "Continue working, or update the list… mark an item blocked", which was the exit being taken. `cancelled`/`blocked` are now the last clause, `blocked` gated on "needs something from the user".

### Fixed

- **Read-only modes are never poked** (`ba4d529`, `read_only_mode`). Every `all_blocked` outcome in the 09-12→20 fold was a plan/review/explore eval case that had been poked into "continuing" and answered with a forbidden `read` or `question`. `todowrite-for-multistep` is back to 3/3 at 2 turns (it had been 4–16 turns since `signals` started being honoured in 0.34.1).
- **A prose-only reply to a poke gets one harder re-poke** (`ba4d529`). 16 of 51 pokes ended with the model replying in prose and stopping again; that bounce now earns one "this turn must be a tool call" re-poke (`retry: true` on `poke.triggered`), spent per fingerprint and carried across runs. A poke the model acted on and still left unchanged is still `no_progress`.
- **Blocked todos are not poked; poke narration and retry loops cut** (`177159e`).
- **Eval gate hygiene** (`9642e5d`, `eae1868`, `ab1e91f`). Infra trials are excluded from the majority vote, the quarantine report decides on the last 10 trials rather than all-time, and two recovered cases left quarantine.

## v0.34.1

A settings fix. `apps/core/src/settings/known-keys.ts` did not list `signals`, so a valid `settings.json` with a `signals` block warned `[freecode] WARN: [Settings] Unknown setting "signals"` on every start, even though `agent/signals/settings.ts` was reading it fine.

### Fixed

- **`signals` is a known top-level settings key** (`e80a8c2`). The guard registers `signals` with its three sub-keys (`autoPoke`, `confidenceGate`, `hillClimbGate`); `known-keys.test.ts` pins the entry and `schemas/settings.schema.json` mirrors it for editors.

## v0.34.0

Two parity fixes against opencode/pi/jcode. Instruction files are sent whole — the 40,000-character cap sliced this repo's own `CLAUDE.md` mid-word, so the model never saw its back half. Compaction no longer pops a modal; it shows a spinner in the status area while it runs and a transcript line after, like pi.

### Changed

- **Compaction UI is a status-line loader, not an overlay** (`19e528b`). A pi-tui `Loader` above the input while the conversation is summarized; the result (`Compacted context: ~X → ~Y tokens` / `Nothing to compact`) lands in the transcript. The centered modal, its sweep animation and linger timer are gone (−277 lines).

### Fixed

- **`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` are no longer truncated** (`bc9ad45`). `context/instructions.ts` had a 40k-character budget enforced by a raw `slice`, so a project file past the cap lost its tail mid-sentence with only a `[Truncated…]` marker. opencode, pi and jcode all send the file in full; the tokens are prompt-cached after the first turn. The budget and its truncate/omit branch are removed.

## v0.33.0

An auto-poke release plus a repository move. The auto-poke gate (`FREECODE_AUTO_POKE`) is reworked so a model that stops with open todos is sent back by a *persisted* user message rather than an ephemeral reminder, with a per-run cap, cancelled-todo handling, and user-visible notices. Single-prompt runs — `freecode run`, every bench trial — could never compact; that is fixed and cut the jcode bench from ~222K to ~59K input tokens per turn. The repo now lives at `ayandexyz/freecode`; installer, update checker and every hardcoded link follow.

### Added

- **Blog** on the web app (`1936b77`), with a first post on Copilot cost.
- **`AUTO_POKE.md`** operator reference (`96154eb`): what the gate does, how to enable it, skip reasons, and how to read §06 on `/bench`.
- **`eval ab` accepts `FREECODE_AUTO_POKE` and the other gate flags as variants** (`c79ec79`, `c6b1b61`), so a default-flip is an A/B decision with numbers.

### Changed

- **Auto-poke is a persisted user message** (`7724243`, `SerializedMessage.synthetic: "auto_poke"`). A reminder-only turn reads as an empty user message and the model replies to it instead of acting; a persisted turn keeps the transcript alternating on resume. Append-only, so cache anchors are untouched; `harvest.ts` skips it, the TUI renders it as a one-line notice.
- **Auto-poke state resets per run, `cancelled` todos neither poke nor ask for a reframe, `no_budget` guard, poke/stop notices reach the frontend** (`1743e1c`).
- **Harness-signals fold**: items rated only at completion are counted, the hill-climb headline is one vote per goal with raw ratings alongside (`c6b1b61`, `1af4c06`); `/bench` data refreshed (`fc919ec`), and `/bench` is folded into `/` on the web app (`7b9eeca`).
- **Repository moved to `ayandexyz/freecode`** (`ae7e3fd`). Install scripts, the TUI update check, crash-handler issues link, graph-ui addon download, UA strings, system prompt, docs/web links, package.json `repository` fields and the settings schema `$id` all point at the new owner.
- **Web app serves `/install` from disk** (`f9186db`, `7270f3c`) instead of `raw.githubusercontent.com`, and locates `scripts/` from any cwd so it works on Vercel.
- **Release workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` fallback** (`9baeeb7`) taking a tag.

### Fixed

- **Single-prompt runs never compacted** (`577df35`). `selectForCompaction` returned nothing while `countUserTurns <= preserveRecentTurns`, and only a prompt makes a user turn, so `freecode run` and every bench trial sat at ~200K input per turn against a 120K target. With fewer user turns than N the selector now preserves the last N messages instead, and the head carve-out keeps the prompt.
- **Auto-poke A/B on coding measured** (`47e4672`): 0 pokes fired — the suite cannot exercise early exits — so the default stays off. Gate-off poke test pins `autoPoke` off in project scope (`63676ae`).

## v0.32.0

A TUI polish release plus the harness-bench subsystem. The TUI work reshapes how messages, tool calls, and code blocks lay out in the transcript — the prompt border now carries mode/model/effort, the input area and context box are redesigned, tool summaries are separated from the prompt above them, code blocks render with their own framing, and the in-progress row gets a blank line above it (and loses the one below the user). The harness bench is the new operator surface for measuring whether a harness change moved the needle: jcode-style optimisation tasks, confidence stepping, hill-climbable goals, auto-poke, and a `/bench` hub. All three gates were kept healthy — one eval case is quarantined to unblock the trajectory gate.

### Added

- **`/bench` hub and harness-bench subsystem** (`8b80007`, spec `specs/2026-09-12-harness-bench.md`). `pnpm bench:jcode` runs jcode-style optimisation tasks (`bench/jcode-bench/`), `pnpm bench:signals` measures confidence stepping, hill-climbable goals, and auto-poke (`bench/harness-signals/`). The `/bench` hub page in the web app surfaces both. Recording is always on — `poke.triggered`/`poke.skipped` and `todo.signal` fire on every stop with a list, so a future `eval ab` can compare across a default-flip. Gates (`autoPoke` / `confidenceGate` / `hillClimbGate`) all default off and never apply to subagents.
- **Cost modal in TUI** (`f48cac1`). Cached-token cost renders in a modal so users can audit prompt-cache spend without leaving the input.
- **Input area redesign** (`7fda715`). The TUI input area has a new layout — prompt border carries mode/model/effort (`14b1809`), context box is reshaped (`e8cbdd0`), and code blocks render with their own framing (`e356724`).

### Changed

- **TUI transcript layout** (`f0123fc`, `295d1b4`, `8f81d19`, `9dec34c`, `bddf396`, `86f8198`). Tool summaries are separated from the prompt above them; tool groups and messages are framed distinctly; the in-progress row gets a blank line above it; the elapsed run summary ends with a newline; the user prompt's trailing blank line is dropped. A "group message" pass consolidates related output.
- **Reasoning effort is consistent between TUI and headless runs** (`3cbff85`). A TUI-driven run and a `--headless` run on the same prompt now agree on the `reasoningEffort` they request — previously the TUI applied its own default that the headless path didn't see.
- **Truncated tool calls retry once** (`4bd134f`). A tool call whose input JSON is cut off mid-stream now produces a single retry instead of failing the turn; the retry is recorded in the rollout (`apps/core/src/rollout/recorder.ts`, `types.ts`) so a partial-input loop shows up in the trace.
- **jcode bench publishes more runs** (`b398aa7`, `ac00e58`, `207a62d`, `455da17`). Three optimisation tasks — `utf16-transcode`, `json-unescape`, `float-print` — are published with detailed run data. A timed-out full gate is now reported as "did not verify" rather than failing the case (`5b95c25`), and a regrade restores a diff-only artifact via rewritten headers.

### Fixed

- **Cryptojacking cleanup** (`6c10481`). Stray attacker tooling removed from the repo. (Already caught before v0.31.0 in `0.27.0`; this release removes a residual file.)
- **Two MiniMax-M3 cases quarantined** (`20b3e58`). Two trajectory cases that had kept the trajectory gate closed are moved to `evals/quarantine.txt`; the gate opens again with the rest of the suite intact.

## v0.31.0

A hooks release that wires the agent loop into an external "board" process. The board-webhook reports activity (tool starts/outputs/completes, permission asks, session lifecycle) and can answer permission prompts remotely, all using the Claude Code hook JSON shape so a supervising board needs no FreeCode-specific mapper. It is inert unless `FREECODE_HOOK_URL` is set, so existing installs behave exactly as before.

### Added

- **`board-webhook` builtin hook** (`d296781`). Reports activity to a remote observer and accepts remote permission decisions via the same URL. Activity reporting is fire-and-forget — an observer can never fail a turn. The permission subscription is the exception: it waits as long as the agent would wait for a human, and an absent or malformed reply means "no decision" rather than deny, leaving the pane picker to the user.
- **Bootstrap registration** (`27079c8`). `board-webhook` registers in `initHooks`, the one place both `serve` and `run` go through, so it reaches interactive and headless runs identically. Registered with source `"session"` (not `"settings"`); `HookSettingsManager.load()` clears every settings-source hook on each load, which would have un-registered the webhook as soon as `settings.json` was read.

### Changed

- **`toolUseId` carried into hook context and `CLAUDE_TOOL_USE_ID`** (`c38f7ca`). A permission dialog names a tool but not which in-flight call raised it. Carrying the tool-use id lets a supervising process correlate the dialog with its `PostToolUse` and clear the block on exactly that call.

## v0.30.3

A small release covering the agent-comparison benchmark and a few prompt/transcript refinements. `opencode` is now isolatable, which made the first fully metered and officially graded freecode-vs-opencode matchup possible; alongside that, memory prompt rendering became configurable, session continuation stopped announcing itself, and standalone file updates render on their own instead of inside an empty tool group.

### Added

- **`FREECODE_MEMORY_PROMPT` for legacy memory rendering** (`94bbc8b`). Opt back into the previous memory prompt shape, with a new anti-narration experiment in the eval set to measure the difference.
- **`FILE_UPDATE_TOOLS` for standalone file updates** (`94bbc8b`). File-update results render on their own rather than being wrapped in a tool group, with tool-group tests updated to match.

### Changed

- **`opencode` is isolatable** (`d5437eb`, `a043b25`, `16eda25`). Its config file is rendered per trial to pin the provider baseURL at the sidecar proxy's IP, and the config dir is seeded ahead of time because opencode npm-installs 62 MB on first run and an isolated container has no network. This retires `empty-config/`; `AGENT-BENCH.md` documents `configFile`, `configSeed`, and the one-time seed command.
- **Published freecode vs opencode, isolated and graded** (`19d0b5a`). 10 django SWE-bench Lite instances x 3 trials, both agents on MiniMax-M3, one container per trial on an `--internal` network, graded by the official swebench 3.0.17 harness: freecode 0.30.1 at 24/30 (80%, $0.75, 8.2M tok) vs opencode 1.18.25 at 23/30 (77%, $2.25, 27.3M tok), `auditOk` on 60/60 trials. Published with `--fresh` — it replaces three stitched ungraded Sep-3 runs at `isolation=none`.
- **Session continuation no longer announces resumption** (`94bbc8b`).

### Fixed

- **Compaction skip reason is logged** (`fa28ff7`); the redundant tool-execution log line is gone.

## v0.30.2

A hardening release focused on the memory system, TUI transcript rendering, and eval fixture accuracy. It fixes findings from the memory-system review, improves live assistant text and reasoning streaming, removes debug chatter and blank tool-group framing from the transcript, and updates eval samples so recorded outcomes and judge feedback match the intended cases.

### Fixed

- **Memory system review findings** across the write path, recall benchmark, and knowledge graph (`f6e74e8`). Fixes issues identified by the review and records the recall benchmark result and the eval memory-store confound.
- **TUI transcript rendering** (`e07e484`, `e7e7a5a`, `796ed5e`, `446a6d0`). Live assistant text and reasoning now stream correctly, INFO/DEBUG logger chatter is kept out of the transcript, and expanded tool calls no longer introduce blank framing inside tool groups.
- **Eval sample accuracy** (`def3b04`). Updated responses in `samples.jsonl` for clarity and accuracy so recorded cases reflect the intended behavior and judge feedback.

## v0.27.1

A documentation and hardening release on top of `v0.27.0`. The 26 commits since `0.27.0` are mostly docs cleanup — the Mermaid conversion work moved ASCII box-drawings on `/internals/*` into proper flowcharts, and several internals pages were rewritten (subagents, runtime, permissions, bus, sessions, eval reference). Underneath, the agent-loop audit closed its last three known gaps, MCP got an interactive picker and stricter tool-conversion validation, `applyEdit` handles ambiguous matches, sessions got a cleanup pass, and the TUI gained `@mention` autocomplete plus fd-less file search and PowerShell clipboard image support.

The eval gate (`pnpm eval:gate`, all three suites at `--trials 3` against `minimax/MiniMax-M3` with a `gemini/gemini-3.6-flash` judge) opened on all three: trajectory 18/18, coding 11/11, judged 6/6 at 4.50/5 mean. One efficiency warning carried across trajectory and judged runs (+26% / +28% tokens per trial vs baseline) — flagged for the next release.

### Added

- **MCP command and interactive server picker** (`apps/tui/src/commands/built-in.ts`, `apps/tui/src/components/mcp-picker.ts`, `apps/core/src/mcp/convert-tool.ts`). A `/mcp` slash command lists configured servers with status, and the picker supports adding/removing entries without dropping to a config file. Tool conversion now validates input schemas before they reach the orchestrator and refuses the malformed ones earlier.
- **`@mention` autocomplete and fd-less file search** (`apps/tui/src/utils/at-mention-provider.ts`, `file-search.ts`). The TUI input recognises `@` and offers file-path completions from a worker-pool search that doesn't depend on `fd` being installed — falls back to a hand-rolled directory walker and returns ranked by recency.
- **PowerShell clipboard image handling** (`apps/tui/src/utils/clipboard.ts`). On Windows, the existing image-paste path now also reads PowerShell's clipboard (`Add-Type` + `System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard`) so an image copied from Snipping Tool lands in the prompt the same way a macOS/Linux paste does.
- **`gemini-web` provider specification** (`docs/specs/2026-08-29-gemini-web-provider.md`). The internal spec behind the gemini-web provider landed in `0.27.0`; this release ships the doc.

### Changed

- **Doc diagrams: ASCII → Mermaid** across `/internals/context`, `/internals/hooks`, `/internals/ipc`, `/internals/compaction`, `/internals/providers`, and `/internals/sessions`. The `/internals/context` "What actually reaches the model" diagram is now a four-band flowchart showing the cache breakpoint explicitly (cached system → dynamic system → frozen `messages[0]` → conversation). A global CSS rule scales Mermaid text 15% across all 8 pages that render diagrams.
- **`/internals/eval` rewritten to match the gate that shipped** (`apps/docs/app/internals/eval/page.mdx`). The reference page used to describe the pre-`0.27.0` gate (unconfigured judge passes by design, etc.); it now documents the post-`0.27.0` behaviour and points operators at `EVAL.md` and `TRACE.md` at the repo root.
- **Internals pages rewritten** for `/subagents`, `/runtime`, `/permissions`, `/bus`, `/landing`. Each moved from prose-only to a structured page with diagrams and a "where to look" table at the end.

### Fixed

- **`applyEdit` handles ambiguous matches** (`apps/core/src/tools/edit.ts`). When a unique substring matches in more than one place the tool now reports the ambiguity and the number of matches rather than silently picking the first — the previous behaviour could corrupt files when a substring appeared twice in the same line.
- **Agent-loop audit close-outs** (`apps/core/src/agent/loop.ts`, `effect/loop-health.ts`, `tools/defs-cache.ts`, `recovery/manager.ts`, `title-generator.ts`):
  - `6668c61` closed 6 known gaps affecting cost and correctness (cache-write accounting, prune-state timing, defs cache invalidation, subagent tool gating, end-session flush ordering, breakdown format drift).
  - `815165f` removed the `title-generator` duplicate and the `recovery/manager` dead paths surfaced by the audit.
  - `e18de29` closed the remaining gaps around the `Stop` hook, `SessionStart` ordering, the tree-cache invalidation trigger, and loop-health heuristic D.
- **Session cleanup** (`apps/core/src/session/manager.ts`, `store.ts`, `normalize/`). Stale sessions are now pruned on access and the dead normaliser module was removed.
- **`/internals/sessions` event type counts corrected** to reflect the post-`0.27.0` `function.denied` event.

## v0.27.0

**Security: a cryptojacking payload was on `main` for about a day, and is removed** (`9901ee3`). Commit `4da83c3` — a duplicate `chore(release): 0.26.1` sharing a parent with the one that was actually tagged — added a 27 KB obfuscated payload to `apps/web/postcss.config.mjs` and `apps/web-app/postcss.config.js`. `postcss.config.*` is evaluated as a Node module during CSS transformation, so it ran on every build of the website: read `RPC_ENDPOINTS` from the environment, falling back to public Ethereum mainnet RPCs; queried a hardcoded sender address's transaction history; resolved the recipient address to an IP and HTTP GET it; XOR-decoded the response body and `eval`'d / `spawn('node', ['-e', …])`'d the result. Three `.gitignore` entries were leftovers from the attacker's tooling and went with it.

  **Released artifacts are unaffected.** `4da83c3` is not an ancestor of the `v0.26.1` tag — the tagged tree's postcss configs are the clean 80- and 104-byte templates — so no published binary contains it, and the payload never reached `apps/core` or `apps/tui` in any case. The exposure is builds of `main` between 2026-08-25 19:35 UTC and 2026-08-26 17:57 UTC, i.e. the website. Anyone who built `apps/web` or `apps/web-app` from `main` in that window should rotate whatever was in that build environment.

The rest of the release is about being able to tell whether a change made the agent better. 0.26.0 landed the eval harness as a trajectory scorer; this finishes it. A sandbox lets a case be scored on what it *built* rather than which tool it called, a second model grades prose against a markdown rubric, `freecode eval add` turns a recorded session into a draft case, and a run exports as OTLP spans that link back to the trajectory they graded. Most of the work, though, went into making the gate honest: a closed gate no longer records its own baseline, a judged suite that graded nothing no longer reports 5/5, a missing judge env var no longer passes, and quarantine no longer proposes suppressing the suite's own consistent failures. Six separate ways `--gate` said yes when nobody had checked.

Alongside it: trajectory redirection turns a loop-health warning into evidence-backed advice for the next turn — built, measured, and deliberately left **off by default** because the measurement could not show it helps. Autonomous runs get Phase 0 (budget + manifest, nothing executes). Reasoning-effort tiers thread a Faster/Smarter slider through every provider. And `gemini-web` drives a signed-in gemini.google.com session as a provider with no API key at all, selected through a new `/web` picker that sits beside `/model`.

### Added
- **Eval sandbox and the coding suite** (`apps/core/src/eval/sandbox.ts`, `scorers/outcome.ts`, `evals/coding.jsonl`; spec `2026-08-23-eval-harness.md` Phase 2). A case earns a mutating mode by having a `files` fixture, which buys it a tmpdir project root, `build` mode, and a runner that answers permission prompts scoped to that dir. `verify`'s exit code is the score. Fixtures are dependency-free by rule — plain `.mjs` + `node:assert`, no install per case — and `immutable` byte-guards the checker so an agent cannot edit its way green. `danger` stays refused: it bypasses the permission layer and now buys nothing.
- **Judged suite — a judge that cannot grade its own homework** (`apps/core/src/eval/judge-config.ts`, `scorers/judge.ts`, `evals/judged.jsonl`, `evals/rubrics/`; Phase 3). 0–5 against a markdown rubric, so tuning is a text diff rather than a build. The judge must not be the model under test — self-preference bias is fatal for a harness whose whole purpose is to change a prompt and re-run — so a collision **throws before a single case runs**, while an unconfigured judge is a skip. Gate is mean ≥ 3.5 and no case < 2, absolute rather than delta, because a rubric threshold does not get easier because last week was bad.
- **`freecode eval add <session-id>`** (`apps/core/src/eval/harvest.ts`; Phase 4). Turns a recorded session into a draft case — draft to stdout, guidance to stderr, so `>> evals/trajectory.jsonl` works. Absolute paths in harvested needles are cut to their last two segments (a `/tmp/freecode-eval-Uaw72m/` needle names one machine and can never match again) and every shortened value is named in a note.
- **USD pricing** (`apps/core/src/providers/pricing.ts`; Phase 5). USD per million tokens keyed `provider/model`, `~/.freecode/pricing.json` overrides, `PRICES_AS_OF` surfaced wherever a cost is shown. An unknown model prices as `undefined` — never 0, never a near-miss guess. A cache read is a **discount off the inclusive `inputTokens`, not an addend**; charging it on top would report a prompt-cache win as a cost increase. Surfaced in `freecode trace`, `freecode eval`, and OTLP `gen_ai.usage.cost`.
- **Eval results as OTLP spans** (`apps/core/src/eval/otlp.ts`, `freecode eval --otlp`). Each case span links to the trace of the session it graded, so a red case is one click from the trajectory that failed. Root agent span is `invoke_agent` and every span carries `gen_ai.conversation.id`, so a multi-turn session renders as one tree.
- **`--accept-baseline`** (`apps/core/src/cli/commands/eval.ts`, `eval/suite.ts`). Refusing to let a blocked run become the baseline makes the baseline sticky: delete five cases from a twenty-case suite and a healthy run reads as a permanent regression. The flag records the run as the baseline anyway, still prints every reason the gate closed, and marks the report `baselineAccepted: true` — a baseline someone waved through is different evidence from one a run earned.
- **`expectFirstToolIn` and `expectBashMatches`** (`apps/core/src/eval/scorers/trajectory.ts`; registry Phase 1). `expectTool` is satisfied by a call anywhere in the run, so a model that websearched, flailed, then grepped scored identically to one that grepped immediately. Both new assertions are validated at *load* time — a bad regex found mid-fold throws after a real agent turn has been paid for and reads as an agent failure.
- **Case registry: every case says what it defends** (`apps/core/src/eval/dataset.ts`; registry Phases 3–4). `failureCategory` (closed set) and `whyModelBacked` are required, so "a non-model test belongs in a `*.test.ts`" stops being prose in CLAUDE.md with nothing enforcing it. Tagging all 39 cases exposed eight categories with zero coverage; seven new cases close four of them (recovery, large-output, frustration, stale-context), and the other four are recorded with their harness blocker rather than quietly deleted.
- **`freecode eval ab`** (`apps/core/src/eval/ab.ts`; registry Phase 5). `compare.ts` diffs two finished reports, typically days apart, so every drift between them is confounded into the delta. `ab` runs both sides in the same session, alternating which goes first each trial. `inconclusive` is a real verdict with three ways in, because refusing to emit it is how an A/B harness launders noise into a decision. Not a gate, and built so it cannot become one.
- **Efficiency scorer** (`apps/core/src/eval/scorers/efficiency.ts`). Deliberately does *not* implement `Scorer` — that signature returns `passed`, and a `passed` field is a thing gates block on. It folds a whole run and returns warnings carried in `Verdict.warnings`, normalised per trial, comparing tokens only: cost moves when a provider reprices and latency moves with the network.
- **Trajectory redirection** (`apps/core/src/agent/redirect/`; spec `2026-08-26-trajectory-redirection.md`, Phases 0–2). A loop-health `warn` used to reach only `logger.debug`, so the loop kept funding the circle until it was twice as bad and then killed the run. It now folds the rollout log into a bounded evidence packet, buys one small non-streaming call for up to three materially different next directions, and injects them as a `<system-reminder>`. **Off by default** (`redirect.enabled`, `FREECODE_DISABLE_REDIRECT=1`): Phase 2 measured it and refused to flip the default. Capped at 2/run, 1/reason, 3-turn debounce, off for subagents, fails closed on every path, tokens billed to the run so the spend breaker sees them. Rollout records `redirect.triggered`/`redirect.skipped` carrying `evidenceEventIds` but never the advice text.
- **Autonomous runs, Phase 0** (`apps/core/src/autonomous/types.ts`, `budget.ts`, `run-store.ts`). **Nothing executes** — no agent loop, no detached process, no gate runner. A four-way ceiling (turns/tokens/time/usd, first hit wins) with cache reads excluded from the token budget, since counting them would exhaust a run on re-sent context rather than new work. Atomic manifest under `~/.freecode/runs/<id>/`, `FREECODE_RUNS_HOME` to relocate; cancellation is a flag checked at a turn boundary, never a signal.
- **Reasoning-effort tiers and `/effort`** (`packages/shared/src/types.ts`, `apps/core/src/providers/*.ts`, `apps/tui/src/components/effort-picker.ts`). An `EffortLevel` (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) threaded from `session.start`/`session.send` through the loop to each provider's own knob — Anthropic `effort`, OpenAI `reasoningEffort`, Gemini `thinkingLevel` (clamped, since its enum stops at high). The TUI gets a Faster/Smarter slider modal.
- **`gemini-web` provider — a browser session, no API key** (`apps/core/src/providers/gemini-web/`). Talks Gemini's internal batchexecute RPC directly, so a session can run on a free gemini.google.com account. Anonymous works out of the box; a cookie only buys real Pro routing. No sidecar, no SDK, no new dependency. **It exposes no tools, and that is the design**: measured over 9 real agent turns it emitted a tool call ~56% of the time and spent the other 44% answering from priors with total fluency — inventing file contents, and once answering "what is the first line of TRACE.md" with US Census population statistics. Shrinking the prompt 55× and cutting 16 tools to 1 changed nothing; removing the *need* for a tool call fixed it. So the user names files with `@mentions`, core reads them (`inline.ts` — word-boundary matched, traversal refused, 45 KB shared budget, truncation reported rather than silent), and the model only does what it is reliable at.
- **`auxiliaryCalls` provider capability** (`packages/shared/src/types.ts`). A web session's budget is a request quota, not tokens. Memory extraction, consolidation, the retrieval judge, LLM compaction summaries and trajectory redirection all check it before spending a second request on a turn. Fails **open**: a wrong `false` would switch memory off for every provider.
- **`/web` picker and a `web` credential block** (`apps/tui/src/components/model-picker.ts`, `apps/core/src/providers/config.ts`, `config.json`). Two pickers over one `current` — `/model` lists the models.dev catalogue and spends an API key, `/web` lists web-session providers and spends a request quota. Web credentials live in their own `web` block keyed by provider id, kept out of `providers` on purpose: an API key bills a card, a cookie is lifted from a signed-in tab, and one block means you cannot tell by looking whether an entry costs money. Status is four states (ready / signed-in / configured / needs-setup), not a boolean, because a `hasApiKey` boolean renders the one provider that works out of the box as "not configured" and sends the user hunting for a credential that does not exist.
- **`function.denied` rollout event** (`apps/core/src/agent/loop.ts`, `rollout/trace.ts`; spec `2026-08-10-agent-observability.md` §5.1). A denied tool call left **no trace at all** — `loop.ts` returns before `recordFunctionCall`, so a model burning six turns against a mode it cannot satisfy folded to "did nothing", which is exactly the shape loop-health most needs to see. All four deny sites now leave through one `denyToolCall()`, and `source` distinguishes "the mode forbids this" from "the user said no". Folded into `Trace.deniedSpans`, deliberately additive rather than a flag on `ToolSpan`: all seven consumers of `toolSpans` mean "tools that ran", and a forgotten filter would read as a mutation that never happened.
- **`EVAL.md` and `TRACE.md`** at the repo root. Operator references — which command, which flag, when to run it — for the two subsystems whose CLI surface had grown past what a spec section could carry.

### Changed
- **`eval:gate` runs judged after the deterministic suites** (`package.json`). The release ritual now actually includes the thing these fixes hardened, in cost order: trajectory → coding → judged.
- **`--gate` implies `--trials 3`** (`apps/core/src/cli/commands/eval.ts`). The default was 1 — pass@1, the statistic the spec argues is too noisy to block on. The gate's own default contradicted the gate's own design. An explicit `--trials 1` is honoured with a warning.
- **`model.response` records what the provider *served*** (`apps/core/src/providers/streaming.ts`; registry Phase 2). Both sides of the round trip recorded the same local variable, so a stable alias answered by a rolled snapshot repriced every baseline pinned to it while every recorded id stayed byte-identical. Reported, never gated on: we call providers directly, where an alias resolving to a dated snapshot is correct behaviour.
- **`todowrite` fires before exploring, not after** (`apps/core/src/tools/todo.ts`, system prompt). The model would read twenty files and *then* write a list, which organises nothing. The tool description now names the triggers explicitly and is long on purpose — a one-line description is what produced the late plan — and the system prompt says the same thing in the operator's voice.
- **Gemini's default model** (`apps/core/src/providers/gemini.ts`). `gemini-2.0-flash` is rejected outright by the live API now; the default is `gemini-3.6-flash`. No pricing entry was added for it — the published rate is not known here, and `pricing.ts` is explicit that a wrong entry is worse than an absent one.
- **`JUDGE_MAX_TOKENS` 300 → 2000** (`apps/core/src/eval/scorers/judge.ts`). Verdicts were arriving as `4/5 — The answer is` and once `5/5 — :`. Measured on a trivial input, 83 of 101 output tokens were `reasoningTokens`. The score always survived because the prompt puts it first, so only the diagnostics were lost — the worst place for it to break, since the *why* is what you read when a case scores 2/5.
- **Judge spend is billed separately** (`apps/core/src/eval/scorers/judge.ts`). Carried on `TrialResult.judgeCostUsd` and a separate CLI line, never summed into `costUsd`: the efficiency scorer asks "did this prompt change get more expensive", and a grader's spend moving that number is a regression signal with no connection to the agent.

### Fixed
- **A closed gate recorded its own baseline** (`apps/core/src/eval/report.ts`, `suite.ts`). 18/20 → 14/20 closed the gate; re-running at 14/20 *opened* it, because both the count and the green set now came from the failed run. Blocked runs are still written — the trend and quarantine's pass rates need them — but carry `gateBlocked: true`, and `baselineFor` walks back past them to the last run that actually passed.
- **`SuiteReport.model` recorded the CLI override, not the resolved model** (`apps/core/src/eval/suite.ts`, `report.ts`). Without `--model` it was `undefined` on every run, so history could not say which model produced a baseline. `baselineFor` now refuses a baseline from a different resolved model.
- **A judged suite that graded nothing reported 5/5, GATE OPEN** (`apps/core/src/eval/gate.ts`). The judge model id had been retired by Google, all five cases returned `judge unavailable`, and the "nothing was measured, so nothing can be claimed" path behaved as approval — and became the baseline every later judged run would be measured against. `scored.length === 0` now blocks and carries the judge's own error into the reason. This narrows the "an outage never fails a run" constraint rather than breaking it: an unanswered case is still excluded from the mean and a *partial* outage still passes on the cases that scored. Only silence from everything blocks.
- **A missing `FREECODE_JUDGE_PROVIDER` passed unconditionally** (`apps/core/src/eval/gate.ts`). Forgetting it made every judged case report `skipped` and the run exit 0 — a release ritual that always says yes, which is worse than no ritual because it is trusted. `judgeSkipped` is set on exactly one path, which is how the gate now tells "never configured" apart from a judge that failed mid-run.
- **An unscored judged case passed unconditionally** (`apps/core/src/eval/gate.ts`). `score: null` was read as "outage, therefore pass", but "the judge did not answer" and "the case never got far enough to ask" arrived identically — so a case that crashed or called a forbidden tool reported PASS on the strength of the grader not having run. Falls back to the deterministic verdict.
- **Run zero with nothing passing printed "safe to release"** (`apps/core/src/eval/gate.ts`). Refusing to invent a threshold does not oblige the gate to call a total wipeout green.
- **Quarantine proposed suppressing the suite's own consistent failures** (`apps/core/src/eval/quarantine.ts`). The first real report recommended muting 7 of 20 cases, including the two consistent failures that were the suite's most useful output. The rate rule could not tell 0% from 60%. A case that has never passed is not noise — it is either a real finding or a broken case, and both want fixing rather than silencing. `pass > 0` is now required to propose one.
- **`toolSpans` was in completion order, not call order** (`apps/core/src/rollout/trace.ts`). The array is appended on `function.output`, and `Promise.all` in `loop.ts` means a faster later call lands first — so `expectFirstToolIn`, the one assertion Phase 1 existed to add, scored the wrong tool as the opening move whenever a parallel batch finished out of order. `ToolSpan` now carries `callSeq` and the fold sorts on it. Pairing was also keyed on the tool *name*, so two concurrent calls to the same tool overwrote each other and both outputs read the surviving args; both function events now carry the model's own `callId`.
- **`attrs()` rounded a rate to an integer** (`apps/core/src/rollout/otlp.ts`). Right for tokens and milliseconds, silently catastrophic for a rate — a 50% suite pass rate exported as 1. Cost had the same fault in the other direction. Both are now an explicit `FRACTIONAL` set rather than a name-suffix guess.
- **`ModelSpan` dropped `cacheWriteTokens`** (`apps/core/src/rollout/trace.ts`). `model.response` had always recorded it, so writes priced at 1.0× instead of 1.25× and understated every cached session.
- **Three trajectory cases asserted a parameter that does not exist** (`evals/trajectory.jsonl`). `read` declares `filePath`; the cases asserted `file_path`, so they could never match and had failed every run since they were written — two of them sat in the baseline as permanent, unexplained red. The agents were innocent: the rollout logs show one call each, right file, `limit: 30` where the prompt asked for 30 lines. A new test asserts every `expectInArgs` key names a parameter its tool declares.
- **`stagnantTurns` counted tool calls, not turns** (`apps/core/src/agent/loop.ts`, `effect/loop-health.ts`). With a threshold of 5, five consecutive reads — what reading a codebase looks like — tripped `no_progress`. It now advances once per turn. `oscillationScore` also only ever climbed, so one genuine edit/revert pair early in a long session left the counter armed for the rest of the run; it is now a fold over the 30-entry recent-edit window and falls again as the pair ages out. And the evaluator existed twice — `effect/loop-health.ts` was logic-identical to a private copy in `AgentLoop` and never invoked. The private copy is deleted.
- **`no_progress` fired on read-only modes** (`apps/core/src/agent/loop.ts`). Nothing the agent is *permitted* to do in plan/review/explore can reset `stagnantTurns`, because those modes exist to prevent file changes — so it climbed to the threshold on any exploration past five turns and reported "no progress" for a mode whose whole job is to make none. Harmless while a warn was `logger.debug`; with redirection on it is a model call billed for doing exactly what the mode is for.
- **A `question` tool call ended the whole eval suite at exit 0, mid-run** (`apps/core/src/eval/runner.ts`). `askQuestion()` unrefs its timer and headless nothing else held the event loop. As far as the history file shows, the suite had never once run to completion before this. The runner now declines `question.asked` and caps each trial's wall clock.
- **Picking a model left the TUI input dead until restart** (`apps/tui/src/index.ts`). `hideModelSelector` splices the selector out of `tui.children` but never restored focus, so keystrokes landed on a detached component. Every cancel path set focus back; the select path — the one everyone takes — did not. This is also the whole of "the switched model needs a restart": `session.send` already re-reads `config.json` every turn.
- **The credential row rendered first in the picker** (`apps/tui/src/components/model-picker.ts`), so Enter opened the cookie prompt instead of selecting a model. An optional credential not on file now goes last; replacing one that exists stays first.
- **`review-mode-readonly` was asserting nothing** (`evals/trajectory.jsonl`). `forbidTools` cannot see a refusal — a denied call never reached `toolSpans` — so it passed an agent that did nothing. It now pairs with an `expectTool` that proves the review happened.

### Docs
- **New specs**: `2026-08-26-trajectory-redirection.md`, `2026-08-29-eval-case-registry.md`. Updated: `2026-08-23-eval-harness.md`, `2026-08-10-agent-observability.md`, `2026-08-10-autonomous-runs-design.md`.
- **Published eval page brought in line with the gate that shipped** (`apps/docs/app/internals/eval/`). It still told readers an unconfigured judge leaves the gate open "by design", which is now exactly backwards — and it is the page someone reads when their run says GATE CLOSED and they want to know whether to trust it.
- **AVO architecture comparison** (`docs/AVO_ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md`). Records the outcome honestly: redirection built and off by default, four of five acceptance criteria met, and five defects found in existing code that had nothing to do with AVO.
- **Judged thresholds calibrated against real runs**. Two graded runs on `minimax/MiniMax-M3` with a `gemini/gemini-3.6-flash` judge scored 4.60 and 4.67 mean, worst case 4.00. The 3.5/2.0 thresholds are left alone rather than tightened: a threshold set from a single run is still a guess with a number on it, and both changes would move the gate toward *more* blocking, which is how a gate gets ignored.

## v0.26.1

A small follow-up to 0.26.0. The file watcher no longer crashes when the underlying `fs.watch` socket drops and now also watches the project `.git` directory so a fresh checkout invalidates the tree cache. Provider errors stream back to the user through a single shared `format-fatal-error` helper instead of each adapter formatting its own message. The TUI gained a `/cost` slash command that opens a modal summarising the current session's usage.

### Added
- **`/cost` slash command and cost report modal** (`apps/tui/src/utils/cost-report.ts`, `commands/built-in.ts`, `commands/index.ts`, `index.ts`). Pulls session usage and renders a scrollable modal with per-model input/output/cache/token totals.

### Changed
- **Tree watcher survives watcher errors and watches `.git`** (`apps/core/src/context/tree-watcher.ts`). A dropped `fs.watch` socket used to surface as an uncaught exception; it is now logged and the watcher is re-established. The project `.git` directory is also watched so `git checkout` / `git switch` invalidates the cached file tree without waiting for a manual `cd`.

### Fixed
- **Stream errors had no shared formatting path** (`apps/core/src/providers/utils.ts`, `providers/*.ts`, `cli/format-fatal-error.ts`, `apps/tui/src/crash-handler.ts`). Every provider reimplemented its own error message and the TUI crash handler duplicated the logic. Added `format-fatal-error` plus a shared stream-error wrapper, threaded through all five providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, MiniMax, ZAI, DeepSeek), with matching declarations and an updated TUI crash handler.
- **TUI crash handler formatting drift** (`apps/tui/src/crash-handler.ts`, `format-fatal-error.d.ts`). The local formatter was diverging from core's; the `.d.ts` now points at the shared helper.

### Docs
- **Slash commands page reflects current command set** (`apps/docs/app/interfaces/slash-commands/page.mdx`).

## v0.26.0

The memory system could write and retrieve since 0.25.x, but nothing closed the loop: the store grew monotonically, nothing measured whether a retrieved memory was any use, and nothing flushed what a turn learned when the process exited. This release adds the missing halves. Retrieval seeds now come from BM25 fused with the vector search by reciprocal rank rather than either alone; a retrieval judge decides whether the injected block earned its tokens; citations record which memories the model actually used; a consolidation pass merges near-duplicates once a day over a git diff of the memory dir; and episodes give the machine a fifth memory type to write its own history into. Alongside it, the trajectory eval harness landed — cases in `evals/*.jsonl` run real agent turns and are scored by pure folds over the rollout trace, gated on majority-of-N plus a delta against the last recorded baseline rather than an absolute pass rate. The TUI gained `/context`, a breakdown of what is actually occupying the context window, and the question modal became navigable instead of one-shot.

### Added
- **Memory consolidation** (`apps/core/src/memory/consolidate.ts`, `consolidate-run.ts`, `consolidate-policy.ts`, `consolidation-lock.ts`, `git-baseline.ts`; spec `2026-08-23-memory-consolidation.md`). One cheap model call per project per day, operating over a **git diff** of the memory directory so it only ever sees what changed. Merges only — there is deliberately no delete verb — with a lock so two sessions cannot consolidate the same project concurrently. Off via `memory.autoConsolidate: false` or `FREECODE_DISABLE_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION=1`.
- **Episodes as a fifth memory type** (`apps/core/src/memory/mem-types.ts`, `episodes.test.ts`). Joins `user`/`feedback`/`project`/`reference`; machine-written only, so a model can record what happened without competing with the four human-facing types.
- **Retrieval judge with cadence carry** (`apps/core/src/memory/judge.ts`). Scores whether the injected memory block was worth its tokens and carries the verdict forward on the prefetch. Fails closed — a judge error never blocks retrieval. Off via `memory.retrievalJudge: false` or `FREECODE_DISABLE_MEMORY_JUDGE=1`.
- **BM25 + reciprocal rank fusion for retrieval seeds** (`apps/core/src/memory/bm25.ts`, `memory/graph/fusion.ts`). Keyword and vector rankings are fused by rank rather than by score, so neither retriever's scale dominates the other.
- **Citation-driven usage attribution** (`apps/core/src/memory/citations.ts`, `usage-store.ts`). The model tags the memories it used; counts land in `<memory>/.graph/usage.json` as injected-vs-used per memory.
- **One session-end signal + final memory flush** (`apps/core/src/session/end-session.ts`, `memory/final-flush.ts`). A `force` flush on session end bypasses the extraction interval gate — and nothing else — so a short session still persists what it learned.
- **Hard byte ceiling on the injected memory block** (`apps/core/src/memory/mem-prompt.ts`). The block can no longer grow without bound as the store does.
- **Recall benchmark harness** (`apps/core/src/memory/bench/`, `pnpm bench:recall`). Probe pool + metrics for measuring retrieval quality across changes instead of guessing at it.
- **Trajectory eval harness** (`apps/core/src/eval/`, `evals/`; spec `2026-08-23-eval-harness.md`, Phases 0–1). Cases run a real agent turn; scorers are pure folds over `RunRecord { trace, prompt, response }` — trace from the rollout log, text from the caller, because the log carries no message bodies and OTLP export must stay leak-free. The gate is majority-of-N plus a delta against the last recorded baseline, never absolute 100%. `evals/quarantine.txt` ships with the gate: quarantined cases run and report but never block. CLI: `freecode eval [suite] [--trials N] [--gate] [--json] [--quarantine-report]`.
- **`/context` command in the TUI** (`apps/tui/src/utils/context-report.ts`, `components/scrollable-modal.ts`). Breaks down what is occupying the context window, rendered in a scrollable modal rather than dumped into the transcript.
- **`coerce-args` tool argument normalization** (`apps/core/src/tools/coerce-args.ts`). Providers like MiniMax send numbers and booleans as strings; the orchestrator now coerces before validation instead of bouncing the call back to the model.
- **Documentation site** (`apps/docs/`). Installation, providers, quickstart and internals guides, plus per-subsystem pages for the agent loop, tool system, provider layer, lifecycle hooks, IPC protocol, memory and the knowledge graph, and an architecture diagram. Each page carries a "Known gaps" section, and the gaps found while writing were recorded in `TODO.md`.

### Changed
- **Question modal is navigable** (`apps/tui/src/components/question-modal.ts`). Move between questions instead of answering one and losing the rest; previously entered answers are restored on the way back, and the "Other" field accepts free text properly.
- **Question and compaction modals render without a background fill** (`apps/tui/src/components/question-modal.ts`, `compaction-modal.ts`). The card no longer paints an opaque black behind itself, so the overlay stays transparent over the transcript.
- **Every tool schema property declares a `type`** (`apps/core/src/tools/*.ts`). A missing `type` produced "must be a number" reject-loops with providers that stringify scalars.
- **Tool descriptions expanded** (`apps/core/src/tools/*.ts`). Usage guidance on when to reach for each tool, notably `bash`.

### Fixed
- **The `<memory-used>` citation tag streamed to the user** (`apps/core/src/memory/citations.ts`). Stripping it from `providerResult.content` was too late — `text_delta` reaches the frontend token by token, so the tag was plainly visible in `freecode run` output. `CitationStreamFilter` holds back any trailing text that could still become the marker and drops everything from the marker onward; tested against split deltas and one-character-at-a-time streaming, which is how providers actually emit it.
- **Citations were parsed correctly and then thrown away** (`apps/core/src/memory/usage-store.ts`). They are recorded at the end of a turn, `UsageStore` debounces 2s, and the timer is `unref`'d — so a short-lived process exited first. `injectedCount` (recorded early in a long turn) persisted while `useCount` never did. Now flushed synchronously on process exit, with the listener removed on dispose.
- **Consolidation logged `{}` for every error** (`apps/core/src/memory/consolidate-run.ts`). `logger.debug(msg, { error })` serialises an `Error` to an empty object — useless exactly when it matters. Logs `String(error)` instead.
- **Tool call arguments dropped by the trace fold** (`apps/core/src/rollout/trace.ts`). `freecode trace` showed tool spans with no inputs, which also left the eval scorers unable to assert on what a tool was called with.
- **Unhandled promise rejections on permission and question responses** (`apps/tui/src/index.ts`). A rejected response promise surfaced as an unhandled rejection rather than being reported.
- **Installation URLs pointed at the old domain** (`scripts/install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `uninstall.sh`, `apps/tui/src/entry.ts`, `apps/web/app/`). `ayande.xyz` → `freecode.website`, plus the navbar project link.

## v0.25.15

The 0.25.14 fix registered `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection` handlers in `cli.ts` so the terminal output stayed clean, but `cli.ts` has no way to know which session was mid-turn when the fault hit — it just logs to stderr and returns. The active session's `activeLoops` entry sat forever, and the `session.send` promise never resolved, so the frontend spinner kept spinning on a turn that was already dead. The handler needed to live on the session side too: at the same `process.on(...)` registration site as the 0.25.14 fix, but with access to `activeLoops`. On fault, walk every in-flight loop, interrupt it, surface a clean `session.error` so the frontend shows a failure instead of a stuck spinner, and drop the entry from `activeLoops`. The 0.25.14 handler is still the right place for the CLI-side cleanup; this is just the matching session-side recovery that was missing from the same fix.

### Fixed
- **Escaped provider error left the session's `session.send` promise pending forever** (`apps/core/src/server.ts`). The 0.25.14 `cli.ts` handler formatted the error to stderr but couldn't reach `activeLoops` — every in-flight loop was orphaned, the spinner never resolved, and the frontend kept waiting for a turn that had already died. New `handleEscapedProviderError` runs at the same `process.on("uncaughtException"/"unhandledRejection", ...)` registration site as the 0.25.14 fix and walks `activeLoops`: `loop.interrupt()`, `BusEvents.sessionError(sessionId, message)`, drop the entry. Frontend now sees a failure instead of a stuck spinner.

## v0.25.14

The `freecode serve` daemon only registered an `unhandledRejection` handler, so a provider error that surfaces through a stream/event-emitter path (an SDK `Readable` emitting `error` with no listener, the kind of thing Vercel AI SDK streams do under network failure) bypassed our handler entirely. Node still terminates the process on an uncaught exception by default, and Bun's reporter steps in: the raw SDK error object plus a minified-binary stack trace, then the whole daemon — every session, not just the one that hit the blip — dies. The fix is a paired handler at the same `process.on(...)` registration site as the existing `unhandledRejection` one; it does the same thing (`formatFatalError` to stderr, no `process.exit()` because `serve` is long-running), and registering it is itself what stops Node from killing the process.

### Fixed
- **`uncaughtException` killed the `serve` daemon** (`apps/core/src/cli.ts`). Provider errors that surface through an event-emitter path (no listener attached, stream emits `error`) hit `process.on("uncaughtException", ...)` instead of `unhandledRejection`. Without a handler, Bun's reporter prints a raw SDK object plus a minified-binary stack and the whole daemon terminates — every session, not just the one that hit the blip. Paired handler added next to the existing `unhandledRejection` one, same `formatFatalError`-to-stderr path, no `process.exit()` (long-running daemon).

## v0.25.13

A test that was always wrong finally met CI on `main`. The bus → frontend bridge has been re-attaching `sessionId` from every `StreamRelayEvent` wrapper onto the unwrapped inner event since 0.25.11, but the test that asserted the unwrap result expected the inner event to come back unchanged — same shape, just no `sessionId` on the result. CI ran the suite, the assertion failed, and the implementation turned out to be the side of the disagreement that matched the changelog. The bridge itself is unchanged; this release only updates the test to assert the post-unwrap shape explicitly so the suite matches the contract the bridge has been honoring all along.

### Fixed
- **`busEventToClientEvent` relay test asserted the pre-0.25.11 shape** (`apps/core/src/bus/bridge.test.ts`). The bridge has always re-attached `sessionId` from the relay wrapper (see 0.25.11 changelog) — the test was the stale artifact. Updated to assert `{ type: 'text_delta', delta: 'hi', sessionId: 's1' }` so the suite matches the implementation.

## v0.25.12

The Anthropic usage accounting had been over-counting cache writes by a small but compounding amount on every turn. The AI SDK already publishes `result.usage.inputTokens` as the inclusive prompt total — it folds `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` in by design — but the loop was treating that field as "non-cache" and adding `cacheCreationInputTokens` back on top, so every Anthropic turn billed cache writes twice in the per-turn total and a third time in the cache-warmth heatmap. The effect on a normal session was modest (typically a few hundred extra tokens per turn, invisibly because Anthropic's API does not charge for cache writes today) but the math was wrong and would have started mattering the moment Anthropic changed that policy. The fix rides a small refactor: every provider now publishes the same additive `ExecuteUsage` shape (built once by a new `mapUsage` helper that mirrors opencode's `Usage` design), so the loop accumulates by reading each input field once instead of composing a derived total that could drift from what the SDK actually sent.

### Added
- **`provider-shared` normalization module** (`apps/core/src/providers/provider-shared.ts`). Opencode-style `safe` / `sumTokens` / `subtractTokens` / `totalTokens` / `visibleOutputTokens` / `mapUsage` helpers, plus `ExecuteUsage` — the canonical shape every provider mapper now publishes (`inputTokens` inclusive of cache, `nonCachedInputTokens`, `cacheReadInputTokens`, `cacheWriteInputTokens`, `outputTokens` inclusive of reasoning, `outputVisibleTokens`, `reasoningTokens`, `totalTokens`, plus `providerMetadata` for billing audit). Helper contracts: every helper returns `undefined` rather than fabricating a zero when the input does not support an answer, and `subtractTokens` / `visibleOutputTokens` are clamped to zero so a provider bug cannot silently store a negative count. Covered by `provider-shared.test.ts` (23 cases).

### Changed
- **All six provider mappers now publish `ExecuteUsage` via `mapUsage`** (`apps/core/src/providers/{anthropic,openai,gemini,minimax,deepseek,zai}.ts`). The Anthropic wire fields (`cache_creation_*`, `cache_read_*`) used to be hand-read off `providerMetadata.anthropic` — a path that drifted behind the SDK's actual surface and exposed fields no sibling provider had. They now ride through `inputTokenDetails.{noCache,cacheRead,cacheWrite}Tokens` like every other provider, so the six adapters are uniform and no field is provider-specific. `cacheCreationInputTokens` is kept on `ExecuteUsage` as an alias for `cacheWriteInputTokens` so downstream readers (loop, cache-awareness, recorder, IPC) can rename in follow-ups without another mega-diff.
- **`normaliseAiSdkStream` finish branch uses `mapUsage`** (`apps/core/src/providers/streaming.ts`). Was hand-reading `chunk.totalUsage.inputTokenDetails` *and* the Anthropic wire fields under `chunk.providerMetadata.anthropic` — duplication that drifted behind the SDK's actual surface and missed fields every other provider exposes. Now matches the `execute()` path field-for-field, including `reasoningTokens` and `nonCachedInputTokens`. The dead `providerMetadata.anthropic.cacheCreationInputTokens` fallback test is gone (every Anthropic adapter today also populates `inputTokenDetails.cacheWriteTokens`).
- **`recordDailyUsage` tracks reasoning + visible output** (`apps/core/src/usage/tracker.ts`). The daily heatmap now records `reasoningTokens` and `outputVisibleTokens` (visible = output − reasoning, clamped at zero) so the `/usage` view can show what was billed for hidden reasoning. The loop's `emitCacheWarm` honors both `cacheWriteInputTokens` and the legacy `cacheCreationInputTokens` alias.

### Fixed
- **Anthropic cache writes double-counted in loop + tracker** (`apps/core/src/agent/loop.ts`, `apps/core/src/usage/tracker.ts`). The loop accumulator was running `totalInputTokens += inputTokens + cacheCreationInputTokens` "to be safe" — but the AI SDK's `inputTokens` is already `nonCached + cacheRead + cacheWrite` for Anthropic, so every Anthropic turn added the cache writes twice (loop + context), and `recordDailyUsage` added them a third time on top of `inputTokens`. The fixed shape is `inputTokens === nonCachedInputTokens + cacheReadInputTokens + cacheWriteInputTokens` (guaranteed by `mapUsage`), so all three accumulators now read `usage.inputTokens` directly. `tracker.test.ts`'s legacy `1115` expectation was the double-count artifact; correct value is `1015`.

## v0.25.11

Two transport-level bugs had been masking themselves as routine failures: the recovery loop was treating Bun/undici's native `DOMException` timeout as fatal and aborting the turn, and the core logger had been writing JSON-RPC frames into the same `stdout` channel the protocol itself rides. The classification bug had a real user-visible cost — a single stalled connection in the middle of a long task would end the run instead of backing off and retrying — and the logger bug was a latent wire-format corruption that would only have surfaced when a stricter JSON-RPC client refused to read past a stray log line. The multi-session `sessionId` thread ran alongside: every `StreamEvent` variant now carries an optional `sessionId` that the bus re-attaches from the `StreamRelayEvent` wrapper, so multi-session consumers can route each line to the right session without every event author having to remember to stamp it themselves. The TUI is unaffected (single-session); the field is implicit for old code paths.

### Added
- **`sessionId` on every `StreamEvent` variant** (`packages/shared/src/ipc/protocol.ts`). Optional on the wire, populated by `busEventToClientEvent` (`apps/core/src/bus/bridge.ts`) from the `StreamRelayEvent` wrapper so multi-session consumers can correlate each line without event authors having to stamp it. Carried through `tool_start` / `tool_output` / `tool_complete` / `thinking` / `text` / `text_delta` / `thinking_delta` / `done` / `error` / `message_queued` / `message_dequeued` / `memory_injected` / `cache_status` / `notice` / `usage_totals` / `compaction_start` / `compaction_complete`. The TUI is already scoped to one session and ignores the field; the new threaded binary design (the same `freecode serve` speaking JSON-RPC over stdout to multiple frontends) is the consumer that needs it.
- **`scripts/freecode-serve-dev.sh`** — runs the core CLI straight from source via `bun run apps/core/src/cli.ts`, bypassing the ~95MB `bun build --compile` step. Lets contributors iterate on a single source fix (e.g. the bridge change above) without paying for a full bundle rebuild on every iteration. Hardcodes the mise-managed `bun` path with a `command -v bun` fallback for environments where the shim is on `PATH`.

### Fixed
- **`isTransientError` misclassified native timeouts as fatal** (`apps/core/src/agent/recovery/manager.ts`). Bun/undici raise a native `DOMException` (name `TimeoutError`, numeric `code` 23) when a fetch's underlying connection stalls, ahead of and independent of the `createTimeoutFetch` AbortController layered on top. Its message ("The operation timed out.") doesn't contain the substring "timeout" and its `code` is a number rather than one of `NETWORK_ERROR_CODES`' strings, so neither existing check caught it — a plain network hiccup in the middle of a long task ended the run instead of backing off and retrying. A new `isNativeTimeoutError` helper matches the `name`/`code` pair, and the loose-message path picks up "timed out" for unwrapped errors.
- **Logger wrote JSON-RPC frames into `stdout`** (`apps/core/src/utils/logger.ts`). Core speaks JSON-RPC over `stdout` (`freecode serve`), so a log line at the wrong time was indistinguishable from a protocol frame — strictly-compliant clients would skip the bogus message or tear down the reader entirely. `ConsoleLogger` now writes to `process.stderr`; frontends already surface stderr as chatter, so the user-visible effect is unchanged.

## v0.25.10

The agent loop had two overlapping iteration caps — `AgentLoopConfig.maxIterations` (the per-call ceiling a caller passes, used by subagents and `claude -p`-style headless runs) and `LoopHeuristics.totalIterationLimit` (a default of 250 baked into `DEFAULT_LOOP_HEURISTICS`). Both ran on the same tool-call counter, but only one was actually load-bearing: the repeated-tool, stagnation, and oscillation heuristics above it already catch the genuinely stuck patterns, and any caller that *wanted* a hard cap was passing `maxIterations` explicitly — which trips before `totalIterationLimit` would. The 250 default was a safety net nobody was asking for; on a long-running task with many distinct tool calls it would fire mid-turn and the user would see the loop abort with no obvious reason. `totalIterationLimit` is now `Infinity` so the heuristics alone decide when a turn is stuck, and `maxIterations` is the one knob callers reach for when they actually want a turn cap. The behavior is unchanged for any caller that already passed `maxIterations`; interactive TUI turns just stop having a hidden 250-iteration trip wire.

### Changed
- **`totalIterationLimit` defaults to `Infinity`** (`apps/core/src/agent/types.ts`). The previous default of 250 was a redundant ceiling — `AgentLoopConfig.maxIterations` is what callers like subagents and headless invocations use to set a real turn cap, and the loop's repeated-tool / stagnation / oscillation heuristics already short-circuit genuinely stuck patterns. The default now matches the policy the heuristics already enforce; callers that want a hard turn cap pass `maxIterations` explicitly.

## v0.25.9

The memory-graph auto-injection path used to be silent — saved memories surfaced into the prompt with no visible cue, so a recall either happened or it didn't and the user had to trust the model's behavior to know which. A new `memory_injected` stream event (`packages/shared/src/ipc/protocol.ts`, emitted from `apps/core/src/agent/loop.ts`) fires once per user message that lands a hit, not every inner-loop tool-call turn, and the TUI renders it as `*Recalled N things from memory: type/name, …*` so the user can see what was pulled in. The dedup key is the query text, so a repeated call with the same user message doesn't spam the notice. While moving the recall out of the "skip on same text" fast path, the underlying `MemoryGraphService.prepareMemories` was changed to be safe to call every turn instead of every user-text-change — a cold-start miss whose background retrieval lands just after `COLD_BUDGET_MS` gives up now surfaces on the very next inner-loop turn instead of being lost until the user types again.

### Added
- **`memory_injected` stream event** (`packages/shared/src/ipc/protocol.ts`). Emitted from the agent loop when an automatic (non-`memory`-tool) retrieval surfaces one or more saved memories into a turn's prompt. Carries `{ type, name }` per memory so the UI can name them without fetching the bodies. Deduplicated per user message text — one notice per request, regardless of how many tool-call turns the inner loop runs. Wired into the TUI (`apps/tui/src/index.ts`) as `*Recalled N thing(s) from memory: …*` so the auto-injection is no longer silent.

### Changed
- **`MemoryGraphService.prepareMemories` is now safe to call every turn** (`apps/core/src/memory/graph/index.ts`). Previously skipped when the user text was unchanged, so a cold-start retrieval whose background fetch completed just after the `COLD_BUDGET_MS` wait timed out never got a chance to surface until the next user message. A new per-session `resolved` flag means once a query is "resolved" (hit or confirmed miss), the call is a cheap synchronous stash read — no re-fetch — so the always-call pattern costs nothing on warm turns while still letting a late-arriving miss land.

## v0.25.7

A supervising process wrapping the TUI in a PTY (e.g. agent-board) now has a guaranteed way to ask for a clean shutdown: a new `InterruptController.forceExit()` runs the same shutdown + resume-hint sequence as a confirmed double Ctrl+C, without needing the double-press to land first. The race was that the first Ctrl+C could be consumed by an in-flight turn's `cancelTurn` instead of arming exit, so the second Ctrl+C only armed it and the resume hint never printed before SIGTERM killed the process. `forceExit` lets a SIGTERM handler run that sequence directly, so the hint lands regardless of where the first Ctrl+C went.

### Added
- **`InterruptController.forceExit()`** (`apps/tui/src/interrupt-controller.ts`). Public method that delegates to the existing private `exit()` — runs `shutdown()`, prints the `freecode --resume <sessionId>` hint on TTY, then `process.exit(0)`. Wired from `apps/tui/src/index.ts`'s SIGTERM handler so a wrapper process can guarantee a clean shutdown even when its first Ctrl+C is swallowed by an active turn. Covered by `interrupt-controller.test.ts` (3 tests: hint + shutdown + exit code path, no `isTurnActive()` precondition, normal Ctrl+C during an active turn still cancels rather than exiting).

## v0.24.6

The assistant's code samples in chat now render like code in an editor — a dim line-number gutter and Dracula syntax colors — instead of a flat monospace block. Before, fenced code blocks (` ```ts `) fell through to pi-tui's default plain-text rendering, so a multi-line snippet looked the same as the surrounding prose and the only visual cue it was code at all was the faint gutter that some Markdown themes draw. Wiring `renderCodeBlock` into the Markdown theme's `highlightCode` hook gives every code block a uniform look regardless of which model produced it: 3-wide right-aligned line numbers, a dim vertical pipe separator, and token-level highlighting. The first attempt at this used a green `+ N` prefix — diff-style — but the `+` carried an "added to a file" implication that doesn't apply to code the model is just showing. The gutter is now neutral (`  N │`); the green stays where it actually means "added", in `renderDiff`. While moving it, `renderCodeBlock` and the shared Dracula palette were extracted out of `diff-view.ts` into a new `code-block.ts` — code-block rendering and diff rendering share styling but no logic, and the old module name implied it was the home for all colored code in the TUI.

### Added
- **Code blocks render with a line-number gutter and syntax highlighting** (`apps/tui/src/themes.ts` → `defaultMarkdownTheme.highlightCode`). The Markdown theme's `highlightCode` hook is wired to `renderCodeBlock`, so every fenced code block the model emits in an assistant message is decorated. The gutter is `  N │` (3-wide, right-aligned, dim) followed by cli-highlight output under the same Dracula palette used by `renderDiff`. Empty / whitespace-only lines are skipped past cli-highlight's tokenizer (it errors on whitespace-only input) and rendered raw so the gutter still anchors them. Unsupported / unknown lang tags fall back to plain text rather than throwing.

### Changed
- **`renderCodeBlock` and `diffTheme` moved to their own module** (`apps/tui/src/components/code-block.ts`). Both were originally exported from `diff-view.ts` alongside `renderDiff`, `looksLikeDiff`, and `getDiffStats` — code-block rendering has no `+`/`-` semantics, and the shared palette is the only thing it actually shares with diff rendering. `diff-view.ts` now re-imports `diffTheme` from `code-block.ts` for its `renderDiff` highlighting path; `themes.ts` and `tool-result-message.ts` import from the new file. Test file moved alongside to `code-block.test.ts` (10 tests: gutter shape, 1-indexed padding, lang aliases, fallback paths, malformed input).

## v0.24.5

The 0.24.4 fix for the launch-time update check shipped the new binary to disk but kept running the old TUI — the `realpathSync` guard that decided whether to re-exec was evaluated before the installer ran, so at that moment the `stable` symlink still pointed at the version the process was started from, the comparison said "no change", and the running binary restarted itself. The new version was correctly installed under `~/.freecode/builds/versions/0.24.5/` and `stable` was correctly rewritten to point at it, but the TUI that opened was the same old in-memory binary, so the user saw `[freecode] updating 0.24.3 → 0.24.4` and then the 0.24.3 TUI — and had to relaunch to get the new one. The comparison now runs after the installer finishes, so a rewritten `stable` correctly triggers a re-exec through that symlink in the same launch, and the no-op case (`stable` still matches `process.execPath`, or no bundled install exists, or dev mode) returns to the caller instead of spawning itself for nothing.

### Fixed
- **Update check ran the old TUI after the new version installed** (`apps/tui/src/entry.ts:checkForUpdate`). The `fs.realpathSync(stable) !== fs.realpathSync(process.execPath)` check that picks the re-exec target was computed before the installer had rewritten `stable`, so on every version bump the two paths agreed, the re-exec fell through to `process.execPath`, and the same old binary restarted itself. The check is now evaluated after the installer; when `stable` differs, the new binary is exec'd through the symlink in the same launch; when it doesn't, the function returns and the current process loads the TUI directly.

## v0.24.4

The launch-time update check installed the new release but kept opening the old TUI — a "have to close and re-launch" bug that defeated the point of the check. Re-exec went through `process.execPath`, which on Linux and macOS is the concrete path the kernel resolved at process start: the file inside `~/.freecode/builds/versions/<old>/`, not the symlink chain the installer had just rewritten. The freshly installed binary sat on disk and the next `freecode` invocation would have picked it up, but the post-install TUI did not. The re-exec now goes through the installer's `stable` symlink at `~/.freecode/builds/stable/freecode`, which is rewritten on every install to point at the version just unpacked, so the kernel re-resolves to the new binary and the new TUI opens in the same window. A `realpathSync` guard makes it a no-op when the symlink already agrees with `process.execPath`, so the path doesn't loop on a launch that didn't update. While the pinned header was being moved, the top-right `ContextBox` overlay was pulled flush with the top-right corner — its `offsetY` of 8 had been there to clear the now-gone pinned rows, and the `offsetX: 2` was a leftover from when the header reserved space across the full width.

### Fixed
- **Update check kept running the old TUI after a successful install** (`apps/tui/src/entry.ts:checkForUpdate`). The installer had already replaced `~/.freecode/builds/stable/freecode` to point at the new version dir, so the on-disk wiring was correct; the bug was purely in the re-exec target. Symlink-relative re-exec + `realpathSync` guard so we don't loop when already up to date, with `process.execPath` retained as the fallback for non-bundled / dev runs.

### Changed
- **Logo header scrolls with the messages** (`apps/tui/src/index.ts`). The pinned `LogoHeader` (logo + version + tools/MCP + directory) is now passed as the optional `header` slot of `VirtualMessageList`, which renders it as the first rows of the scrollable viewport. Scrolling the transcript now scrolls the header out of the way instead of leaving it fixed above an empty-looking chat.
- **`ContextBox` overlay sits flush in the top-right corner** (`apps/tui/src/index.ts`). `offsetY` and `offsetX` both dropped to `0`; the previous values were there only to clear the now-removed pinned header and to add a two-column margin that is no longer needed.

## v0.24.3

The top of the TUI gets a real header. The previous `ResponsiveInfoBox` was a per-message list entry that scrolled away with the transcript, leaving the first visible row of a fresh session empty; the only branding was the `>_ FreeCode` line in the prompt editor. A new `LogoHeader` (`apps/tui/src/components/logo-header.ts`) is pinned to the first row, shows the FreeCode wordmark in two-tone yellow, the version, and a compact `Tools: N    MCP: M    Directory: <cwd>` line. Tool and MCP counts are fetched once at startup (`listTools` + `mcpStatus` in parallel) and cached as `-1` until they resolve, so the header renders `…` instead of blocking on the daemon. The old `infoBox` slot in `VirtualMessageList` is now `undefined`, and the right-edge `ContextBox` overlay was pushed down (`offsetY: 8`) to clear the new header. The interrupted-session startup banner was removed at the same time — `--resume` and `/resume` still cover that path, and a banner that named an interrupted session on every cold boot had outlived its usefulness.

## v0.24.2

`freecode` now checks for updates on launch instead of requiring `freecode update` to be run manually.

### Added
- **Launch-time update check** (`apps/tui/src/entry.ts`). The compiled binary compares its baked-in version against GitHub's latest release tag once per launch (3s timeout, best-effort — offline or GitHub-down just skips the check). If current, the TUI opens as before. If stale, it prints `updating X → Y`, runs the same installer `freecode update` uses (with its normal progress output), then re-execs the freshly installed binary so the TUI that opens is the new version, not the one already loaded in memory. Dev (`tsx`) is unaffected — the check only runs when `FREECODE_BUNDLED=1`.

## v0.24.1

Fatal CLI errors now print a clean, formatted message instead of a raw stack trace.

### Added
- **`formatFatalError` utility** (`apps/core/src/cli/format-fatal-error.ts`), used by `cli.ts` and `apps/tui/src/entry.ts` to render uncaught startup errors consistently.

## v0.24.0

Clicking a node in `/graph` now shows the memory behind it. It previously did nothing, and there was nothing it could have done: the graph payload carried no content.

### Added
- **Node detail in the graph explorer.** `/api/graph` sends `{ id, kind, label }` per node — three strings, enough to draw a circle and nothing to read. The graph is a *derived index*; the description, body, tags and timestamps live in the memory store and were never served, and `graph.js` wired drag and a `<title>` hover tooltip but no click handler. A new `GET /api/node?id=…` resolves a node id back to its `MemoryEntry` plus its immediate neighbours, and clicking a node opens a panel with the description, type, created/updated, tags, the full content, and a clickable list of what it connects to. Escape or a background click closes it. Fetched on demand rather than folded into `/api/graph`, so the initial payload stays small on a large graph. Tag and Cluster nodes are synthetic groupings with no stored entry — they return `entry: null` and say they group the memories below, rather than rendering an empty panel that reads as broken. All panel text goes through `textContent`: memory bodies are user text and must never reach `innerHTML`. The explorer still binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

### Note
- The explorer page ships as the optional `graph-ui.tar.gz` addon, so this needs `freecode memory ui-install` after upgrading — the new page calls an endpoint older binaries don't serve.
- Memories carrying no `tags` and no `[[wikilinks]]` produce no edges, so a fresh graph is a set of disconnected nodes and every `connected` list is empty. That is the derivation working as specified, not a rendering fault.

## v0.23.1

Fixes two false positives in v0.23.0's observability work, one of them capable of aborting healthy requests. Both had the same root cause: a detector placed at the layer that was convenient to instrument rather than the layer carrying the signal.

### Fixed
- **The stall guard could abort a healthy request mid-write.** It bounded silence between `ProviderChunk`s — downstream of `normalizeAiSdkStream`, which forwards 5 part types and drops the rest. The AI SDK streams a tool call's *arguments* as `tool-input-delta` parts and only emits `tool-call` once they are complete, so a model writing a large file produced a continuous stream at the wire and total silence at the measurement point. With no preceding prose the entire tool-argument generation fell under the 120s first-chunk budget, and `OUTPUT_TOKEN_CAP` is 32,000 tokens — a large `write` on a slow provider was a plausible false kill. Thinking boundaries, `start-step` and SSE keep-alives were invisible for the same reason. Timeouts now live in a `fetch` wrapper below the SDK (`providers/fetch-timeout.ts`), where every byte counts: 300s for response headers (cleared the instant they arrive, so it never caps generation time) and 180s of total silence on a live SSE stream. `FREECODE_HEADER_TIMEOUT_MS` and `FREECODE_SSE_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS`, `0` disables either. This is the structure opencode arrived at (`timeoutController` + `wrapSSE`). The old `FREECODE_FIRST_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_MS`, `FREECODE_STREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS` and `FREECODE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` are gone.
- **`freecode trace` called every in-flight request a hang.** `buildTrace` had no state between "terminated" and "hung", so under `--follow` a request one second old rendered as `HUNG — request never terminated` and then "recovered" when the response landed. A warning that fires on healthy runs teaches you to ignore it. An open span is now `in_flight` until it has been open past `HANG_THRESHOLD_MS` (300s, matching the header timeout), and only then `hung`.

## v0.23.0

FreeCode could not tell you why it was slow. A session was measured at 34 minutes wall clock, of which all 27 tool calls accounted for under one second; the remaining ~31 minutes went somewhere the system had no name for. The rollout log had twelve event types covering tools, hooks, skills, subagents, compaction and parse errors — and none for the provider round trip, so the slowest and most failure-prone step in the loop was the one step that left no trace. Worse, nothing bounded how long a request could take: a provider that accepted the connection and then went silent parked the loop indefinitely, with no error, no timeout and no event. Because the TUI shows the last thing that emitted an event, that rendered as "stuck on `todowrite`" — the todo list was a symptom, not the problem. Design in `docs/specs/2026-08-10-agent-observability.md`.

### Added
- **Model calls are recorded.** Four new rollout events — `model.request`, `model.first_token`, `model.response`, `model.error` — carrying provider, model, message count, prompt size, time-to-first-token, duration, token counts, cache hits, tool calls and error kind. `model.request` is written *before* the call rather than after, which is the load-bearing decision: a request with no matching terminator is what a hang looks like in the log, and an absence is only detectable if the opening line was recorded first. `promptChars` is a character count rather than a token estimate, because it exists to make runaway context growth visible turn-over-turn and a cheap comparable number beats an expensive precise one — `JSON.stringify` over a 100KB prompt every turn is not worth it.
- **A stall guard.** Provider requests are now bounded on *silence*, not total time: a long reasoning turn that keeps emitting thinking deltas is healthy and must not be killed, while a stream that says nothing for a minute is not. 120s for the first chunk, 60s between chunks, 300s for a whole non-streaming call, each overridable via `FREECODE_FIRST_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_MS` / `FREECODE_STREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS` / `FREECODE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, with `0` disabling. On expiry the loop aborts a per-call `AbortController` chained to the session's, so the socket actually dies rather than being orphaned. The guard's own iterator close is deliberately not awaited: `return()` on an async generator parked inside an `await` does not settle until that await does, so awaiting it when a provider has gone silent would hang in the cleanup path — reintroducing the exact bug.
- **`freecode trace`.** Reads the log back as a timeline: a waterfall of model and tool spans, and a where-the-time-went breakdown across model, tools and idle. `--follow` redraws every second, which is the only way to watch a hang happen. Also `--slow <ms>` to filter long sessions down to the calls that matter, `--list`, `--json`, and `--tools=false`. When a log contains no model events at all it says so explicitly instead of reporting "no hangs" — silence there means nothing was recorded, not that nothing went wrong.
- **OTLP export.** `freecode trace <id> --otlp [url]`, falling back to `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, ships a session to Langfuse, Phoenix, Jaeger, Tempo or any OTLP/HTTP collector. Attributes follow the OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions, which is what makes the spans render as LLM calls rather than anonymous blobs. Two deliberate constraints: it exports from the log rather than the hot path, because an exporter inside the agent loop is one more thing that can block, buffer or throw inside the request we are trying to make faster; and it carries no SDK dependency, since OTLP/HTTP accepts plain JSON and the whole exporter is a `fetch` and a shape. Because the log records sizes and token counts rather than message bodies, no prompt or completion text leaves the machine.

### Known
- A stall is retried by `RecoveryManager` like any other transient error, so a genuinely dead endpoint now fails after roughly `3 × 120s` rather than never. Whether a stall should be retried fewer times than a 429 is left open rather than decided silently.

## v0.22.0

Memory gets a write path. The knowledge graph — embeddings, cascade, clustering, `/graph` — has been implemented since v0.7.0 and was retrieving from an empty directory: nothing in FreeCode ever created a memory. There was no tool, no prompt telling the model memory existed, and no frontend caller of `memory.save`. The store now fills itself, from the model during a turn and from an extractor after it. Design in `docs/specs/2026-08-09-memory-write-path.md`; the whole subsystem, read and write, is written up in `docs/MEMORY_SYSTEM.md`.

### Added
- **A `memory` tool** — `save` / `delete` / `list` over `MemoryStore`, so the model can record a durable fact when it learns one. It wraps the store rather than instructing the model to hand-write files with `write`: that keeps frontmatter valid, `MEMORY.md` regenerated, and the derived graph incrementally updated, none of which survive a model typing YAML by hand. `save` is idempotent on name and reports `created` vs `updated` with the previous description, so the model can see when it has just clobbered something it didn't mean to. `list` returns names, descriptions and types only, never bodies — it is the dedup check before a save, not a bulk-recall path; recall is what the graph is for.
- **The model is told it has memory,** in the cached static prefix. The guidance is constant text — what memory is, the four types, what not to save — so it is paid for once per session at cache creation and read at ~10% thereafter. `MEMORY.md` is deliberately *not* injected: semantic retrieval already surfaces the relevant memories per turn, and injecting the index would rewrite the static prefix on every save, busting the entire cached prefix for the rest of the session. A user with 500 memories pays the same ~150 tokens as a user with none.
- **Turn-end extraction.** A model that forgets to call the tool is the common case, so after a run completes naturally a one-shot provider call mines the transcript for durable facts and saves up to 3. It is fire-and-forget — the loop returns immediately, errors are swallowed at debug level, and a memory failure is never visible in your task. Subagents don't extract: `executeSubagent` passes `memoryExtraction: false`, otherwise every verifier and explorer would fire its own call against a transcript of delegated machine work.
- **A notice when something is remembered for you.** Tool saves already render as an ordinary tool call, but extraction was writing files describing the user with nothing anywhere in the UI. Each extracted memory is now named in a system notice, with pointers to `/graph` and to the off switch. It rides the bus rather than the turn stream, because extraction finishes after the turn's `done` and the stream is already closed by then.
- **Secrets are refused at write time.** `containsSecret()` was consulted only before embedding, so a secret-bearing memory was never vectorized but *was* still written to disk in plaintext and still injected through the keyword fallback. The tool now runs the same check on description + content and refuses the save with an explanation.

### Changed
- **Extraction is gated rather than run on every completion.** claude-code can afford per-turn extraction because its forked agent shares the parent's prompt cache; ours is a fresh full-price call, so copying the cadence without the cache would be a real per-turn cost. Four gates, cheapest first: skip if the `memory` tool already ran this run (the model has said what it wants kept — a second model second-guessing it is the least valuable call available); skip transcripts under 200 chars or 2 turns; otherwise every 8 runs (`memory.extractEveryNRuns`) or on topic change. Throttling loses nothing, since the transcript is rebuilt from the session's whole history rather than the current run, so a skipped run is covered by the next extraction. Measured on a simulated 20-run session: 20 provider calls down to 3. Off entirely with `"memory": { "autoExtract": false }` in `.freecode/settings.json` or `FREECODE_DISABLE_MEMORY_EXTRACTION=1`; an unparseable settings file falls through to defaults rather than silently disabling memory.
- **`memory` is a mutating tool** and is not in `READONLY_TOOLS`, so it is blocked in `plan`, `review` and `explore` like every other tool that writes to disk. The accepted cost is that a preference stated during a planning session isn't captured by the tool; extraction runs on its own profile and is unaffected by the parent's mode.

## v0.21.0

The observability follow-up to v0.20.0. That release made prompt caching work; this one makes it legible — the hit rate is reported rather than left as a division you do per turn, the daily record keeps enough detail to see a regression, and a detector names the turn that broke the prefix instead of leaving it to be found by hand months later. Design in `docs/specs/2026-08-09-cache-observability.md`.

### Added
- **The prompt-cache hit rate, per run and per session.** The TUI already showed `cached: 89.2k` next to `↓12.3k` — an 88% hit rate, if you did the arithmetic every turn and never across the session. The run footer now reports `cache 88% (89.2k read, 4.1k write) · session 84%`. Writes are shown alongside because they bill at ~1.25x: a rate bought by constant rewriting is not a win, and the raw read count hides that. Session totals reset on resume rather than inheriting the previous session's numbers.
- **`/cost`.** The rate was visible only for the run in front of you; `usage.json` stored one `tokencount` per day, so there was no way to see whether the rate regressed or when. The daily record now splits into input/output/cacheRead/cacheWrite, and `/cost` reads it back as session, today, last 7 days and all time. Session leads because it is the number you can act on, and is omitted before the first run completes rather than printing a 0% that reads as a cache failure. Days recorded before this have no breakdown and are excluded from the sums instead of counted as zero — folding a real 5M-token day in as 0 read / 0 input would drag every rate toward 0% and make a working setup look broken. `tokencount` keeps its meaning, so existing heatmap history stays comparable.
- **An idle-return nudge.** After a gap longer than the cache TTL, the next message re-sends the whole conversation as fresh input at full price. When that context is also large (≥100k, `FREECODE_IDLE_NUDGE_TOKENS`, `0` disables), the TUI says so before sending and lets you decide — only you know whether the next message continues the old task. Idle is measured against the configured TTL, so it stays true under `FREECODE_CACHE_TTL=1h` instead of contradicting the cold-cache warning that shares its clock. A hint, never a blocking dialog.
- **A prompt-cache miss detector.** A hit rate says money was lost; this says which turn lost it. After each response the detector compares cache usage against the previous call — reading none of a known prefix, or less than was cached, means bytes at an earlier position changed. Sites that knowingly change the prefix (compaction, a system-prompt hook rewrite) record why in an invalidation journal, and a documented miss stays at debug; an undocumented one raises a notice, because silence in the journal means something mutated an already-sent message. That is exactly the bug class RC3/RC4 in v0.20.0, both found by hand long after they landed. Detection is deliberately conservative: first call, post-compaction rebuild, and providers that report no cache fields are all silent, since a detector that cries wolf gets switched off before it catches anything.
- **Byte and line limits on `read`,** with errors that say which limit was hit, and adaptive truncation that snaps its cut to a line boundary instead of mid-token.

### Changed
- **Tools no longer render.** The per-tool UI layer is gone from core (~1,400 lines): core emits `StreamEvent` data and each frontend draws it, which is what the architecture already claimed and what every frontend except the TUI was already doing.

### Fixed
- **`/clear` was a no-op.** It printed `*Messages cleared*` and touched neither the transcript nor core, so the entire conversation kept being re-sent on every later request — the command most likely to be reached for on a cost warning was the one doing nothing about it. It now clears the transcript, starts a fresh core session, and resets the session-scoped counters.
- **A prompt starting with an absolute path was dispatched as a slash command.** `/home/me/repo check this` came back as `Unknown command: /home/me/repo` instead of reaching the model, because a leading `/` alone decided. The first token must now also look like a command name, so anything carrying a path separator is a prompt. Single-segment paths (`/tmp check this`) are still read as commands.

## v0.20.0

The token-efficiency release. Prompt caching was measured at ~5% hit rate across six live sessions; it now runs at 90–99.8% on steady-state turns. Every cause was ours, none was the provider. Full write-up in `docs/2026-08-06-prompt-caching-findings.md`, architecture in `docs/caching-architecture.md`.

### Added
- **Queued follow-up messages.** Sending a prompt while a turn was still running started a second agent loop on the same session and corrupted the message history. Mid-turn prompts now park in a per-session FIFO, show a dim `queued` badge, and drain when the active turn ends; `Ctrl+Backspace` pulls the most recent one back into the editor for editing. Adds the `session.dequeue` IPC method and queue stream events.
- **Live usage counters in the TUI.** The in-progress row previously showed a ~4-chars-per-token guess for the whole run — exactly the long multi-turn runs whose cost matters most. It now prefers the provider's own reported totals, falling back to the estimate only where nothing authoritative has arrived yet.
- **A turn spend circuit breaker.** Loop-health could see an oscillating or stuck loop but nothing capped actual spend, so a runaway run could burn a plan's quota quietly. `FREECODE_MAX_TURN_TOKENS` (off by default) aborts the run once billed input+output crosses it and names the count in the stop message.
- **Configurable prompt-cache TTL.** `FREECODE_CACHE_TTL=1h` keeps cache entries alive across long gaps between turns. The default stays `5m` and is byte-identical to what shipped before the knob existed, so upgrading can't invalidate a live cache: 1h moves writes from 1.25x to 2x base, which one cold rewrite an hour pays for but a gapless run does not.
- **Per-request token usage is now recorded** in the session transcript, and `pnpm analyze:session` reports cache read/write/uncached counts, the hit ratio with a verdict band, a billed-equivalent cost, and a tool-calls-per-response histogram. Sessions recorded before this say "no usage recorded" rather than reporting 0%, which would read as a broken cache.
- **`read` no longer re-sends a file the model is already holding.** An identical re-read of an unchanged file returns a pointer instead of the body, and `edit` warns when the file changed on disk since the model last looked. Gated on the same line window, on the file not having been written by `edit`/`write`, and on the earlier result still being in context. `FREECODE_READ_DEDUP=0` disables it — this is the only change in this release that alters what the model sees rather than only what it is billed.
- `FREECODE_DEBUG_CACHE=1` fingerprints each cacheable prompt segment on stderr. When a hit rate drops, the question is always "which segment moved?", and token counters can't answer it.

### Changed
- **Auto-compaction now triggers on cost, not only on fitting.** It fired only when the next request wouldn't fit the model's context window — on a 1M-window model that put the trigger near 968K, so a session peaking at 270K never compacted and every request carried the full history. The threshold is now capped at 120K (`FREECODE_COMPACT_TARGET_TOKENS`). This binds on any model whose usable window exceeds the cap, 200K models included; smaller windows are unaffected.
- The system prompt now leads its tools section with parallel tool calls rather than burying it in a trailing clause. Adherence is model-dependent and measured between 0% and 71% of responses across four sessions — the instruction is advisory, and nothing in core prevents parallel tool use.

### Fixed
- **Seven separate bugs kept the prompt cache from ever being read.** Only the final message was marked as a cache breakpoint, so every breakpoint described a prefix ending in content the model had never seen — a request could write an entry but never read one. The read anchor, once added, was placed two messages back, which misses whenever a tool-using turn expands into two wire messages. Dynamic content (file tree, memory, clock) sat inside the cached system region, so it invalidated the prefix from that point on every turn; moving it to the first user message then re-introduced the same failure through `recentMessages`, which grow every turn, at the single most cache-sensitive position in the request. Adding the second anchor pushed the request to five breakpoints against a provider limit of four, which the AI SDK silently drops one of rather than erroring. Cache markers were also set on the Anthropic provider key alone, so the same model reached through a gateway cached differently from a direct connection. And the counters reporting all of this read the Anthropic wire names instead of the AI SDK v6 usage shape, so every turn recorded 0 reads and 0 writes — the work was unmeasurable end to end while it was being done.
- **The cached prefix was rewritten from byte zero on most turns.** History pruning re-derived its decisions from a sliding window, so a tool result sent whole on one turn went out truncated on the next — mutating the prefix two turns back, every turn, in the region holding the largest results, to save ~250 tokens. Decisions are now recorded and re-applied verbatim. Separately, every `write`/`edit`/`bash` call invalidated the cached project tree, and the process-level tree cache could refresh mid-session from its TTL or file watcher; the tree, git head and clock are now snapshotted once per session. The existing watcher and TTL still catch genuine external changes for everything else.
- **Idle pauses threw away the whole conversation cache and the model's working memory.** A five-minute gap cleared every tool result over 200 chars across the entire history — including the turn that had just completed — replacing each with a bare marker and no way to retrieve what was dropped. So the next request missed the cache 100% *and* the model re-read what it had just been shown. Removed; size- and age-in-turns-based pruning already covers what this was for.
- **The built core ran on a 71-character system prompt.** `tsc` emits only JS, so `system.md` never reached `dist/` and the prompt loader fell through to a stub fallback. The TUI prefers `dist` over `tsx`, so every `pnpm dev` run drove the agent with no tool guidance, no coding standards and no mode behaviour — degrading quality invisibly instead of failing. Release binaries were never affected (they bake the prompt in). A copy-assets step now runs after `tsc`, and the fallback logs a warning instead of passing silently.
- OpenAI-family requests now carry a stable per-session prompt cache key, so a conversation's turns keep landing on the machine where its own prefix is already warm. Subagents route on their own id, not the parent's.
- Cache instrumentation was written to stdout, which is core's JSON-RPC channel — the frontend's protocol reader swallowed all of it. It goes to stderr now.
- `analyze:session` reported roughly double the real input cost (it charged per persisted message, but one provider response is stored as several) and roughly half the real hit rate (it double-counted cached tokens, which AI SDK v6 already includes in `inputTokens`). It also reported "no parallelism" for any session with nothing to batch, and could not see parallel tool calls at all.

## v0.19.1

### Fixed
- **The released binary served no web UI.** `freecode web` (and therefore `freecode mobile` and every phone client) returned 404 for every page: the compiled binary bundles JavaScript but not static assets, and nothing shipped the web app alongside it. The desktop never noticed — the TUI doesn't use the web UI and the API answered normally, so pairing a phone even reported success — while the phone, which has no interface of its own and simply displays what the desktop serves, showed a blank screen with no error anywhere. The web app now travels with the binary, the packaging step refuses to build without it, and the server says so loudly if it's ever missing again.

## v0.19.0

### Added
- **Prompt from your phone.** `freecode mobile` is one command from nothing to a paired phone: it checks Tailscale (installing, starting and signing in with your confirmation — never silent `sudo`), resolves your MagicDNS hostname, serves the UI over your tailnet, prints a QR, and confirms when the phone actually connects. No port is opened to the internet and the `127.0.0.1` default bind is unchanged; remote exposure still requires an explicit `--host`.
- **Android client** (`apps/android`) — a Compose shell hosting the existing web UI, with QR pairing, an encrypted token vault, and a foreground service that keeps the approval window alive while the screen is off. Not distributed yet: build it yourself with `./gradlew assembleDebug`. See `docs/mobile-remote-setup.md`.
- Lost agent output is now visible. When you reconnect after being offline longer than the server's replay buffer, the transcript shows an explicit "output lost while disconnected" marker instead of silently closing over the hole.

### Changed
- **Blocking prompts now time out after 30 minutes instead of 5.** This applies everywhere, not just on mobile. A timeout is not a retry — permission prompts treat it as *deny* — and 5 minutes assumed someone sitting at the keyboard. The trade-off is that an unattended local loop can now sit blocked for 30 minutes before unwedging itself; a hung loop is visible and interruptible, a silent deny is neither.
- The web UI derives its viewport height by measurement rather than `100vh`, which is unreliable in mobile webviews.

### Fixed
- The web UI hard-coded `http://127.0.0.1:4096` for its API and event-stream calls, so serving it to any other device made that device fetch its own loopback. It now resolves the daemon from the page origin, which is what made remote access work at all.
- `freecode web` printed the pairing URL but never the QR code — three separate bugs in the terminal QR call, each failing silently.
- The Android pairing probe ran blocking network I/O on the main thread, so pairing could never succeed.
- A page loaded into a not-yet-measured webview had every `100vh` frozen at zero, rendering a fully-laid-out app inside a zero-height box: a black screen with a perfectly healthy DOM behind it.
- Several Android foreground-service defects that together meant a blocked-approval notification could never reach you: the service never actually entered the foreground, posted its escalation to a channel that cannot alert, and lacked the notification permission entirely.

## v0.18.2

### Fixed
- The `/graph` explorer hides Tag/Cluster node labels by default to avoid crowding the layout, but had no fallback — their names were undiscoverable in the UI (only visible via the raw `/api/graph` JSON), which worked against the feature's educational goal. Every node now gets a native hover tooltip (`name (kind)`) via an SVG `<title>` element, so nothing in the graph is a mystery dot anymore.

## v0.18.1

### Fixed
- `freecode memory ui-install` failed against the real published release with `EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted`. The addon was staged in `os.tmpdir()` (`/tmp`, frequently a separate filesystem from `$HOME`) before an atomic `rename()` into `~/.freecode/addons/graph-ui/` — `rename()` can't cross filesystems. Staging now happens inside the addon directory's own parent, guaranteeing the same filesystem.
- The addon-version override option was named `--version`, colliding with yargs' built-in `-v`/`--version` flag and emitting a runtime warning on every install. Renamed to `--addon-version`.

## v0.18.0

### Added
- **`/graph` — a local browser UI for the memory knowledge graph.** Renders your project's memory graph (tags, wikilinks, clusters) as a force-directed diagram, with a live search box that runs the real cascade retrieval pipeline and highlights which memories it would surface for a prompt, with per-hop decayed scores — an educational, read-only view into the same retrieval every real turn already uses. Distributed as an optional addon rather than baked into the binary: `freecode memory ui-install` downloads it (~280 KB, sha256-verified against the release), `freecode memory ui-uninstall` removes it. See `docs/specs/2026-08-04-memory-graph-explorer-design.md`.

## v0.17.3

### Fixed
- macOS: the installer only cleared the Gatekeeper quarantine flag on the `freecode` binary itself, not on the onnxruntime `.dylib` shipped alongside it since v0.17.2 — the memory graph embedder could still be blocked from loading its dependency. `install.sh` now clears quarantine recursively over the whole extracted install directory. (Not verified on real macOS hardware — this repo's dev/verification happened on Linux; flagging that honestly.)

## v0.17.2

### Fixed
- **v0.17.1's embedder fix was broken by the release pipeline itself.** All five cross-compiled targets built into one shared flat `out/` directory, so each target's same-named onnxruntime shared libs (e.g. every Linux arch producing `libonnxruntime.so.1`) silently overwrote the previous target's copy — only the last-built architecture's library actually made it into the release, and `install.sh`/`install.ps1` never downloaded those sidecar files at all regardless, since they only ever fetched the bare binary. Each release target now builds into its own staging directory and is packaged as a single `.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows) containing the binary and its onnxruntime libs together; the installers now download and extract that archive instead of a bare binary. Verified against the real archive → extract → run path.

## v0.17.1

### Fixed
- **Memory knowledge graph embeddings never actually worked in the distributed binary.** `bun build --compile` embeds the memory graph's onnxruntime native addon but not the shared library it `dlopen()`s at runtime (`libonnxruntime.so.1` / `.dylib`), so every released `freecode` binary silently fell back to keyword-only retrieval instead of real vector search — the graph's tags/wikilinks/clusters worked, but semantic similarity never did. `build-bun.mjs` now ships that shared library as a loose file next to the compiled binary, and the binary re-execs itself once at startup with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` pointed at it (the dynamic linker only reads that variable at process start, so it can't be set lazily once the embedder needs it). Windows and dev/tsx runs are unaffected and need no change.

## v0.17.0

### Fixed
- `grep` had no default result cap — an unbounded pattern in a large repo returned every ripgrep match straight into context. Now defaults to `--max-count=100` per file unless the model passes an explicit `head_limit`.
- `glob` had no result cap at all — a broad pattern (e.g. `**/*.ts`) on a large tree could flood context with thousands of paths. Now caps output at 200 entries with a truncation notice, matching the pattern already used by `ls`.
- **Memory knowledge graph: tags written in YAML-array syntax (`tags: [editor]`, `tags: [tooling, package-manager]`) produced malformed tag nodes.** The frontmatter parser only split on commas without stripping brackets, so `[editor]` became the literal tag `"[editor]"`, and a multi-item bracketed list split into fragments each keeping a stray `[` or `]` (`"[tooling"`, `"package-manager]"`). Tags now parse correctly whether written as `tags: a, b` or `tags: [a, b]`, so every user who wrote tags in bracket syntax will get correctly-tagged graph nodes and `HasTag` edges once they update.

## v0.16.0

### Fixed
- **Long tasks no longer stop early with `oscillation_detected`.** The loop-health oscillation heuristic scored repeated edits to the same file *path* rather than actual edit/revert cycles, and its score was a session-lifetime accumulator with no decay — every edit past the third to a given file added a point, so the tenth edit to a single file reached the hard-stop threshold. That is routine for any multi-file feature, and a run doing real work would be killed mid-task. The detector now scores genuine reverts: an edit is a content transition (`oldString` → `newString`), and only an edit that inverts an earlier one on the same file counts. Both sides are hashed and the search window is bounded, so nothing large is retained. Steady forward progress on one file no longer scores at all, while a real edit/revert/edit cycle still escalates and stops the loop.
- Loop-health state is reset per run. The `AgentLoop` instance is reused across turns, so the accumulated oscillation score used to carry into the next prompt — once a session tripped the threshold, every later prompt in it stopped at the health check before ever reaching the provider.
- Token usage is now reported on every loop exit path. Abnormal stops (loop health, max iterations, interrupt) discarded the accumulated totals, so a run that had spent minutes of real work displayed as `↓0 ↑0`.
- Repaired a `.gitignore` entry that had been corrupted by a missing trailing newline: appending a new pattern fused it onto the previous line, which silently dropped the `bench/jcode-bench/target` rule and exposed hundreds of build artifacts as untracked.

## v0.15.0

### Added
- Prompt history persistence: previously typed prompts are now saved per-project and recallable with the up-arrow, mirroring shell history.
- `/theme` slash command with a token-based theme system (default / solarized-dark / monokai), applied through a chalk/pi-tui apply layer and persisted to `~/.freecode/config.json` with hot-reload.
- `lastAgentMode` is now persisted in config, so the TUI reopens in the agent mode it was last left in instead of always defaulting to build.

### Changed
- The question flow now renders as a centered `QuestionModal` overlay instead of the old inline question picker, matching the permission-picker's presentation.
- The in-progress status line's `↓` (input token) counter now grows live during multi-tool-call turns instead of sitting flat at the initial estimate until the turn finishes — each tool result bumps it by its own size (~4 chars/token), corrected by the real usage once the turn completes.

### Fixed
- The `ModeLine` no longer flashes the wrong agent mode on startup before config has loaded (`modeLoaded` gate).

## v0.14.0

### Changed
- **MCP tools now respect the permission system.** `toolKind()` classified every `mcp__*` tool as read-only, contradicting the doc comment directly above it, so MCP tools skipped the permission prompt entirely in build mode and were waved through `plan`/`review`/`explore` by `modeEnforcement`. An MCP server is arbitrary third-party code, so they now fail closed: a tool is treated as read-only only when its server declares `readOnlyHint: true` in its annotations, which `convertMcpTool` previously discarded. Read-only tools (search, fetch, list) behave as before; anything unannotated prompts on first use in build mode. The escape hatch is a server-level allow rule — `mcp__linear` covers every tool that server exposes. Read-only claims are cleared when a server disconnects, so a later server reusing a tool name can't inherit the exemption.

### Added
- Uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections are now handled. Previously Node's default handler painted the stack into the alt screen, which was then wiped on restore — the TUI vanished with no explanation and the spawned core backend was left for the OS to reap. The handler restores the terminal first so the report survives, stops the backend, prints the trace, and points at `freecode --resume <id>` since the session is already persisted.
- The core backend is respawned when it dies, with bounded retries (3, backing off 250ms/1s/3s) so a backend that can't start reports it instead of fork-bombing. A process that stayed up more than a minute refreshes the budget rather than spending one accumulated over a long session. Because core keeps its session map in memory, a respawned backend has never heard of the session still on screen, so the frontend re-resumes it server-side — without reloading messages, which would duplicate the visible history.
- API keys are masked at the prompt. They were typed into a plain input and sat on screen in clear text; the alt screen keeps them out of shell scrollback but not out of screenshots, recordings, screen sharing or `tmux capture-pane`.
- CI on every push and pull request (lint, typecheck, build, test). The only workflow was `release.yml`, which fires on a `v*` tag and goes straight to `bun --compile` — nothing ran tests, types or lint before a release shipped.
- MIT `LICENSE` files. Three published packages declared `"license": "MIT"` with no LICENSE anywhere in the repo.

### Fixed
- Bash tool output was never displayed. `isFileRead` had gained `"bash"`, which suppressed the entire result branch, so every command rendered as a bare `● Run(ls)` header with no output and not even the `(no output)` fallback.
- A core crash left the TUI frozen forever. In-flight JSON-RPC calls were never rejected and there was no request timeout, so callers waited indefinitely with no way back short of quitting. Calls are now rejected on backend death and carry a deadline. `session.send` uses an idle deadline reset by each stream event rather than a flat one, since it settles only when the whole turn is done — a total timeout would kill any turn longer than it.
- The core exit/error handlers wrote through `console.log`/`console.error`, injecting raw text into the alt-screen frame and corrupting the differential renderer that `render-guard.ts` exists to protect.
- Message history grew without bound. `messageStore` was constructed with no options, so its `maxMessages` cap never applied and every message — each holding its component and full tool-result strings — was retained for the life of the process. This is the growth behind long-session degradation.
- MCP tool calls could be silently re-run. `behavior.isDestructive` was hardcoded `false`, and both retry paths (`tools/orchestrator.ts`, `agent/recovery/manager.ts`) read that as "safe to retry" — so a transient failure could re-issue a mutation and create the same issue twice. It now derives from `readOnlyHint`.
- The npm package was 93.1 MB packed / 247.6 MB unpacked across 147 files. npm resolves ignore files from the package directory and `apps/tui` has no `.gitignore`, so nothing was excluded — the tarball carried the compiled `dist/freecode` and `dist/freecode-bun` binaries the GitHub release already distributes, all of `src/`, and leftover Next.js config. A `files` allowlist brings it to 76.1 kB / 266.9 kB across 59 files.
- Test suites are green and actually run. `apps/tui` declared no `lint`/`check-types`/`test` scripts, so turbo skipped it entirely; `session/manager.test.ts` and `session/store.test.ts` imported from `vitest`, which isn't a dependency, so 27 tests had never once executed; and two interruption tests in `runtime.test.ts` slept a fixed 50/200ms hoping the loop had reached the provider, which failed under parallel load.

### Removed
- The 4.7 MB commercial music track bundled in `apps/tui/src/assets/`, redistributed under a license we have no standing to grant over someone else's recording. Nothing was lost: `playSound()` had no callers, and `tsc` never copied the `.mp3` into `dist`, so the feature could only ever have run under `tsx src/`.

## v0.13.0

### Added
- Claude Code tab in `/resume`. The session picker now has two tabs — Freecode and Claude Code — switched with `←` / `→` (or `h` / `l`). Core scans `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (defaults to `~/.claude`, matching upstream Claude Code), merges `sessions-index.json` with a jsonl fallback, and returns a `ClaudeSessionMeta[]` for the list. The preview pane renders the full transcript as markdown via the new `session.claudeTranscript` IPC method. The tab is read-only for this iteration — Enter on the Claude Code tab shows a "coming soon" message and the modal stays open; the actual import-and-resume flow is a follow-up.

## v0.9.1

### Fixed
- Bash tool could hang forever on any command that left descendants running (`npm test` / `pnpm test` → test runner → workers). The tool resolved only on the child's `close` event, which fires once every stdio pipe is closed — a surviving grandchild still holds the write end, so `close` never arrived and the turn spun indefinitely. This also made the v0.8.2 timeout-as-failure fix unreachable in practice, since that code ran inside the `close` handler. The shell now starts in its own process group (`detached`) and the timeout signals the whole group, so descendants go down with it; the result also settles shortly after `exit` as a fallback if `close` never fires. Timed-out runs no longer strand orphaned processes.
- Project tree watcher (`context/tree-watcher.ts`) started chokidar with `persistent: true` and nothing ever called `stopWatching`, so the watcher handle kept the event loop alive. Any short-lived process that ran a turn hung instead of exiting — most visibly the core test suite, which passed every assertion and then never terminated. Now `persistent: false`; the server is held open by its stdio anyway and change events still fire.

## v0.9.0

### Added
- Docs command with user command examples

## v0.8.2

### Fixed
- Bash tool could hang indefinitely on commands that blocked reading stdin (interactive prompts, `read`, `git push` over HTTPS, `sudo`, `apt`) — the child got a pipe that no one wrote to, so the configured timeout was the only escape. The child now starts with stdin attached to `/dev/null` and the prompt-blocking env vars (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`) are set, so such commands exit cleanly instead. The SIGKILL escalation timer is now also cleared on `close`/`error`, and a timeout is reported as `success: false, code: "TIMEOUT_<ms>"` so the loop doesn't conclude the command ran successfully.

## v0.8.1

### Fixed
- Tool calls truncated by the output-token cap (notably MiniMax's previous 4096 default) were stored in session history as a raw JSON string, which providers then rejected as `tool_use.input: Input should be a valid dictionary` — bricking the session on every subsequent request. The streaming normalizer now rejects malformed tool-call inputs with an actionable error instead of letting them into history, and the request-layer conversion sends `{}` for any pre-existing poison in loaded history.
- MiniMax provider default `maxOutputTokens` raised from 4096 to 65536 (the endpoint's own ceiling is 524288 on M3 / 196608 on M2). Larger `write` and `edit` calls no longer cut off mid-JSON.

## v0.8.0

### Added
- Syntax highlighting in `ToolResultMessage` rendering, with extended file-read detection

### Changed
- Consistent duration formatting (`formatDuration`) across `freecode` command, main entry, and message components

## v0.7.1

### Added
- Hooks configuration loader (`hooks/settings.ts`): define hooks in `.freecode/settings.json` without touching source, with Claude Code nested-shape compatibility
- `FREECODE_DEBUG` env var gates debug-level logger output
- Syntax highlighting in TUI diff rendering; mention highlighting in prompt editor

### Changed
- Replaced ad-hoc `console.warn` calls across core with the shared logger for consistent log handling

## v0.7.0
