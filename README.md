**FreeCode** is a terminal coding agent. You give it a task in plain language; it
reads your repository, runs commands, edits files, and reports back — driving the
work itself through a single agentic tool-use loop rather than asking you which
files it needs.

It talks to roughly **198 providers** derived from [models.dev](https://models.dev)
— Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, xAI, MiniMax, Z.ai, and
every OpenAI-compatible endpoint behind them — through one generic driver. You
can also sign in with an **Anthropic Pro/Max subscription** instead of an API
key — opt-in, and [read the stance first](#install) — or pick a
**web-session provider** (`/web`) that talks to Gemini through your signed-in
browser session, spending a request quota rather than tokens.

Everything intelligent lives in one CLI backend. The TUI, the VS Code extension,
the web UI, and the desktop app are presentation layers that speak JSON-RPC to it.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://freecode.website/install | bash
```

On Windows, use PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://freecode.website/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then, in any project:

```bash
freecode
```

Pick a model with `/model` before your first prompt — a fresh install has no
provider selected, and FreeCode refuses to guess one rather than sending your
prompt somewhere you never chose. Full walkthrough:
[Quickstart](https://freecode.website/getting-started/quickstart).

Using an Anthropic subscription instead of an API key:

```bash
freecode auth login anthropic
```

> **Read what that does before you run it.** Subscription inference is only
> reachable by presenting FreeCode to Anthropic **as Claude Code** — its OAuth
> client id, its headers, its identity line. Anthropic reserves that inference
> for its own surfaces and has acted against tools doing this, and the account
> at risk is yours. It is opt-in, off by default, and one `freecode auth logout`
> away. Full stance:
> [Anthropic subscription login](https://freecode.website/getting-started/anthropic-subscription).

Using a ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription for `openai` instead of a key:
`freecode auth login openai`. It logs in as the Codex CLI and talks to the Codex
backend — same kind of trade, same opt-in, same `freecode auth logout openai`.
Details: [OpenAI subscription login](https://freecode.website/getting-started/openai-subscription).

Using a web session instead of a key at all: `/web` in the TUI lists
**web-session providers** (`gemini-web` today). It calls the Gemini web client's
own endpoint — anonymously by default; a cookie from a signed-in tab in
`config.json`'s `web` block buys the Pro model. No token accounting exists on
that path, so the budget is **requests, not tokens**: the session throttles by
returning empty replies, and FreeCode spaces tool-loop requests, retries an
empty reply on a 20 s clock, and caps `@file` inlining at 45 KB because history
is re-sent every turn. Tool use rides a text protocol (`[TOOL_CALLS]` / `FINAL:`)
that can be switched off with `FREECODE_GEMINI_WEB_TOOLS=0`. It is not browser
automation — nothing drives a browser.

## What it does

- **One agentic loop.** The model receives your prompt, project context, and a
  tool set, then drives the work — no separate "which files do you need" pass.
  Independent tool calls run in parallel batches.
- **Real streaming, native tool calling, extended thinking, prompt caching**, and
  usage accounting across every provider, through the Vercel AI SDK.
- **Web-session providers** — `/web` runs the same loop over a signed-in Gemini
  web session instead of an API key: throttle-aware retries, request spacing,
  and a payload budget, since the quota there is requests rather than tokens.
- **Agent modes** — `plan`, `build`, `review`, `explore`, `danger` — enforced by a
  permission layer with per-rule allow/ask/deny and path-scoped rules in
  `.freecode/settings.json`.
- **Persistent memory across sessions**, with a derived knowledge graph (local
  ONNX embeddings, clustering, cascade retrieval) and an opt-in graph explorer.
- **Durable sessions** — resume, fork, export/import, and automatic compaction
  when the context window fills.
- **Extensibility** — MCP servers, skills (`SKILL.md`), lifecycle hooks, and
  `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` instruction files.
- **Observability** — every model call is recorded as an event; `freecode trace`
  renders the waterfall, and runs export as OTLP spans.
- **An eval harness** — behaviour changes are verified by scored agent runs, not
  by eyeballing a transcript.

**Key principle:** frontends only render and speak IPC. No provider calls, no
file reading, no tool execution outside `apps/core`.

> A legacy browser-automation path (Playwright, driving a signed-in ChatGPT
> session) still exists under `apps/core/src/browser/`. It is not the default
> execution path, and it is distinct from `providers/gemini-web/`, which is a
> live web-session provider that never drives a browser.
