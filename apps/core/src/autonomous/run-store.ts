// Run store — manifest read/write under ~/.freecode/runs/<run_id>/.
//
// Writes are atomic (tmp + rename), matching `memory/graph/vector-store.ts` and
// `memory/usage-store.ts`. This is not ceremony: the run that owns a manifest is
// a detached child that can be killed at any moment, and a half-written
// manifest is indistinguishable from a corrupt one — the file is the only place
// a crashed run's state survives.
